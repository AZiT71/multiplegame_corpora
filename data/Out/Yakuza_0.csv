At first glance, you’d think this economy has made Japan a more prosperous place. But I believe someday this upward trend will end, and that it all might come crashing down.

Half-Japanese kids like Tachibana-san weren’t real popular, as you’d imagine. He had it damn rough, growin’ up. Chinese all hated his Japanese guts on account of the war. Said he coulda been killed for bein’ a half-blood any day, and nobody woulda batted an eye. Minus one exception. Apparently the local mafia were the only ones that never treated him rough for it. Guess they were all outcast types. Nobody had any money, and most of ‘em came from bad families, y’know? So Tachibana-san just naturally went down that road, too, from a real early age.

They called me a “Japanese devil.” Behind that term was a war’s worth of venom against Japan. I grew up fearing everyone around me, until the day I fled the country… leaving my mother and sister to fend for themselves in China, alone. After growing up hated for being a Japanese boy in China, now the Japanese called me Chinese. Those early days in Sotenbori were spent just desperately trying to stay alive. To defend myself. Once a person sets foot in the underworld, the only way to survive is to devour those around you. To climb a ladder fashioned from their bones. Show a moment’s weakness, and they’ll devour you instead. Just after I had finally grown numb to it, lost all sense of good or evil, or any interest in the difference… I learned my mother and sister had come to Japan. To Kamurocho. I left Sotenbori to find them, and used whatever power and influence I’d won to set down roots in Kamurocho. To form a network of knowledge. What I would do once I found them, I had no idea. I only knew I could not live not knowing what misery I had caused them by abandoning them in China. In the end, all I learned was that my sister had vanished from Kamurocho just before I could find her, and that my mother and grandfather had already died. That, and one other thing… That the tiny plot of land my sister now held the rights to had the potential to become a fatal obstacle to the Kamurocho Revitalization Project.",,N,Ya0-5391,Ya0-5393

Even Kazama-san would be unable to stop him. Kazama-san advised me to build a real estate firm around the intelligence network my search had created.
