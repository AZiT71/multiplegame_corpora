DeSt-80,,,,[],,Y,DeSt-79,DeSt-81
DeSt-81,,,Igor,"The world was different when I was a kid. America was a country. Anybody could go anywhere they damn well pleased. No need for couriers like yourself. We had highways, airplanes hell, you could even visit other countries! Hard to imagine it now. As you can see, the Death Stranding poked us fulla holes. Fucked us beyond all recognition. And if you were lucky enough to survive, the timefall came and washed you away… Then those freaks from the Beach showed up. The worlds of the living and the dead all mixed together… And that’s when folks started holing up in the cities. And couriers like yourself got put up on a pedestal. Son of a bitch. Rainbow!",,N,DeSt-80,DeSt-82

DeSt-108,,,,[],,Y,DeSt-107,DeSt-109
DeSt-110,,,Man in Red,"Oh, you’re awake. So how does it feel? To be back in the world of the living? Don’t worry, I’m a doctor. Well, a coroner. Originally. Call me Deadman. I’m well-acquainted with the dead.",,N,DeSt-109,DeSt-111

DeSt-118,,,,[],,Y,DeSt-117,DeSt-119

DeSt-121,,,Sam,Right. Where am I? What time is it?,,N,DeSt-120,DeSt-122
DeSt-122,,,Deadman,"Watch me. Try pressing it against your skin like this. Relax. That just means your body’s got a good connection to the cuff link. Look, look! The cuffs will watch over you 24 hours a day. That is to say, we will. We’re here to help.",,N,DeSt-121,DeSt-123
DeSt-123,,,Sam,What the hell… Two days?,,N,DeSt-122,DeSt-124
DeSt-124,,,Deadman,"During that time, we took the liberty of collecting fluid samples from you. You’re a repatriate. That makes you very special.",,N,DeSt-123,DeSt-125
DeSt-125,,,Sam,What happened to the CD guys?,,N,DeSt-124,DeSt-126
DeSt-126,,,Deadman,"Central Knot was obliterated in the annihilation. “Game over, man.” Place is a crater. The only ones to get a continue were you for obvious reasons and your broken bridge baby.",,N,DeSt-125,DeSt-127
DeSt-127,,,Sam,Is it all right?,,N,DeSt-126,DeSt-128
DeSt-128,,,Deadman,"It’s been marked for disposal. Didn’t work anymore. Why keep it? We lost everyone. Not just Corpse Disposal. My team, HQ —all of Vredefort… Every soul in Central Knot City. We’re at our base in Capital Knot City now or should I say our new headquarters. Sudbury seemed the logical choice. But our implementation team has been decimated, and there’s on so much they can do in two days. Things here are a mess. Fortunately, the director and his support team were out of town at the time, so the chain of command remains intact. I hate to do this so soon, but I have a job for you.",,N,DeSt-127,DeSt-129
DeSt-129,,,,[],,Y,DeSt-128,DeSt-130
DeSt-130,,,Deadman,This stencil is from when you repatriated? Ah… What’s the other mark from?,,N,DeSt-129,DeSt-131
DeSt-131,,,Sam,A clingy woman in a cave.,,N,DeSt-130,DeSt-132
DeSt-132,,,Deadman,"I see… Aphenphosmphobia? No wonder you were out there alone. Where no one could touch you. I’ll try to be more careful, Sam. So, the job is an urgent delivery. I need you to bring the president some morphine.",,N,DeSt-131,DeSt-133
DeSt-133,,,Sam,What president? America is gone. You talking about the mayor of Central Knot?,,N,DeSt-132,DeSt-134
DeSt-134,,,Deadman,"No, no, no, no. Not the mayor. America lives on, Sam. The president is in the final stages of cancer—in critical condition—but there’s still time.",,N,DeSt-133,DeSt-135
DeSt-135,,,Sam,Why me?,,N,DeSt-134,DeSt-136
DeSt-136,,,Deadman,"Look Sam… Do as I ask, and I promise it will all make sense.",,N,DeSt-135,DeSt-137
DeSt-137,,,Sam,Why don’t you do it?,,N,DeSt-136,DeSt-138
DeSt-138,,,Deadman,Because I’m not really here.,,N,DeSt-137,DeSt-139
DeSt-139,,,,[],,Y,DeSt-138,DeSt-140
DeSt-140,,,Deadman,Apologies. This is just a chiralgram. And here ugh… come the tears. Allergic reaction to the chiral transmission. I’m actually over in the isolation ward. In the big triangle building. Ah. Here is the morphine. Bridges hereby enters into a contract with Sam Porter.,,N,DeSt-139,DeSt-141
DeSt-141,,,Sam,"Come on, you’ve got morphine there. What’s this about? Tell me the truth.",,N,DeSt-140,DeSt-142
DeSt-142,,,Deadman,"The truth, Sam, is that America’s last president wants to see you in person. Are you really about to say no?",,N,DeSt-141,DeSt-143
DeSt-143,,,,[],,Y,DeSt-142,DeSt-144
DeSt-144,,,Deadman,Very good. I see you in the isolation ward.,,N,DeSt-143,DeSt-145
DeSt-145,,,,[],,Y,DeSt-144,DeSt-146
DeSt-146,,,Deadman," Delivery order for Sam Porter Bridges. Request transport of morphine to isolation ward for immediate administration to the president. Check the map on your cuff links if you’re lost, Sam. The isolation ward should be pretty obvious. If you’re not sure how to get there, you can set markers and draw routes, too. Try it out and you’ll see what I mean.",(on record) ,N,DeSt-145,DeSt-147
DeSt-147,,,,[],,Y,DeSt-146,DeSt-148
DeSt-148,,,Deadman,"Sam. Your friendly neighbourhood Deadman here. If you want to confirm you’re headed the right way, check your compass. It’ll never steer you wrong-provided you have a destination, that is. Central wasn’t just home to Bridges HQ. It was also the seat of the Reconstructionist movement. If the president hadn’t required special treatment, she would have never have left. And if she hadn’t, we wouldn’t have either.",,N,DeSt-147,DeSt-149
DeSt-149,,,,[],,Y,DeSt-148,DeSt-150
DeSt-150,,,Doctor 1,"Like I said, her vital signs are all trending the same way.",,N,DeSt-149,DeSt-151
DeSt-151,,,Doctor 2,"No chance of a recovery, then?",,N,DeSt-150,DeSt-152
DeSt-152,,,Doctor 1,"None that I can see, no.",,N,DeSt-151,DeSt-153
DeSt-153,,,Doctor 2,We should start making preparations…,,N,DeSt-152,DeSt-154
DeSt-154,,,Deadman,"Sam, it’s me. Deadman.",,N,DeSt-153,DeSt-155
DeSt-155,,,,[],,Y,DeSt-154,DeSt-156
DeSt-156,,,Deadman,Sorry! My mistake.,,N,DeSt-155,DeSt-157
DeSt-157,,,,[],,Y,DeSt-156,DeSt-158
DeSt-158,,,Deadman,I’m afraid the president’s condition has deteriorated. Thank you. This will help to ease the pain… and allow her to speak with you in these final moments.,,N,DeSt-157,DeSt-159
DeSt-159,,,Sam,“Her”?,,N,DeSt-158,DeSt-160
DeSt-160,,,Deadman,The first and last female president of the United States. Surely you remember her? She raised you. You’re not exactly dressed for a reunion. Take that off before you come inside.,,N,DeSt-159,DeSt-161

DeSt-171,,,Sam,Amelie?,,N,DeSt-170,DeSt-172

DeSt-173,,,Sam,"Still going on about that, huh?",,N,DeSt-172,DeSt-174
DeSt-174,,,Bridget,"You’re the one I wanted to send, Sam. Time’s running out. Help Amelie. She needs you. Together you can help us reconnect. You can make America whole. Sam, if we don’t all come together again, humanity will not survive.",,N,DeSt-173,DeSt-175

DeSt-195,,,Sam,What are you talking about?,,N,DeSt-194,DeSt-196
DeSt-196,,,Die-Hardman,As a member of Bridges you’re going to work with the rest of us to rebuild America.,,N,DeSt-195,DeSt-197
DeSt-197,,,Sam,You think you can recruit me? Like she tried to?,,N,DeSt-196,DeSt-198
DeSt-198,,,Die-Hardman,"Well, she succeeded. Look at your wrist. If that’s not symbolic, I don’t know what is.",,N,DeSt-197,DeSt-199
DeSt-199,,,Deadman,"Director, the cancer spread throughout her entire body. Harvesting organs is out of the question, and there is no need for an autopsy. Her body needs to be cremated before she necrotises.",,N,DeSt-198,DeSt-200
DeSt-200,,,Die-Hardman,"And if we don’t, this place’ll turn into another crater.",,N,DeSt-199,DeSt-201

DeSt-203,,,Die-Hardman,"The road from the Capital Knot City to the incinerator was compromised in the voidout. Now, the only way there is on foot, through the mountains. But the chiral density there is off the chart. It’s gotta be BTs.",,N,DeSt-202,DeSt-204

DeSt-351,There’s no pretending,,Die-Hardman,"Listen up, Sam. The terminals Amelie’s people built in the towns and cities they passed through on their journey west are called KNOTs. The infrastructure’s there, but the chiral network is offline. Right now, it’s only capable of transmitting voice communications sometimes wired, sometimes wireless, and a small amount of data. So, unless the necessary data’s stored on site, our chiralgrams won’t show up. Amelie and the other Bridges members you’ve seen around the place are “grams” generated with local data, in case you didn’t know. Anyway, all you’ve got to do is find the KNOT, connect your Q-pid, and bring chiral communications online. Once you connect it to the terminal, you’ll be able to initiate “zero time massive data transmission” with the UCA network. And just like that, you’ll reconnect us not only to each other, but to our past. All the lost and fragmented junk data will be compiled and restored. Like bringing a dinosaur back to life from a fossil… 4.6 billion years of history on Earth, all the wisdom and knowledge we lost since the Death Stranding will be ours again. And that, my friend, is how we’ll beat this thing. Once you establish chiral communications, generating “grams” won’t be an issue. You’ll also be able to use chiral printers.

They’ll also provide people with the means to defend themselves when traveling outside the city limits. The shipment also includes a variety of medicines, as well as human sperm and egg samples. These specimens are essential for maintaining genetic diversity as they were donated by civilians living outside the major population centers. By taking advantage of chiralium’s temporal properties, we can ensure they remain viable for as long as required. After the shipment’s been processed, connect the Q-pid. Now once that’s done, the entire region will be integrated into the chiral network. Afterwards, you’ll be pushing on to Lake Knot City… so we’ve included relief supplies for the people there as well.

The living soon walked the shores of the afterlife, while dead things-beached things-began to find their way back. And then came DOOMS, and with it a host of theories advanced by physicians and psychologists desperate to explain the world’s newest mystery.

They can’t die. They don’t have Beaches. No matter how far they come, machines’ll never understand death like we do. And because of that, they’ll never truly surpass us. Get on the delivery terminal.

Simple, run-of-the-mill orders only. Take a look at what’s available. Cargo transported by a bot is liable to get a little roughed up if the road’s poor. On the flip side, a bot traveling on a well-maintained road is more likely to deliver cargo in better shape. Also faster, in case it wasn’t obvious. Keep that in mind when sending them out. Now we wait for the delivery bot to reach its destination. As of today, there’s just one, but if the test succeeds, we’ll move ahead with mass production. Then you’ll be able to dispatch them yourself. Oh, uh… seems I misspoke. We managed to slap together another delivery bot for field testing. You can decide how to use this one.

DeSt-948,There’s no pretending,EPISODE III “FRAGILE”,Deadman," Hey, Sam. I have some new info you should hear. Recently recovered thanks to your efforts to expand the chiral network. It, um… it concerns BBs. I dug this up on my own, just to be clear. No one ordered me to look. And if anyone asks, put it all on me. No need for you to deal with any blowback. You were just listening to me ramble on the wire, okay? Anyway… It looks like Bridges wasn’t the first to bring back BB tech. …It was a group of separatists. Terrorists opposed to UCA expansion, according to the records. They started using them about three years ago. Right around the time Bridges I was putting plans in place to head west. Seems these separatists were having trouble with BTs, too… and figured that if they could track them, they might be able to steer them into our path. When Bridges caught wind of this, the decision was made to fight fire with fire-to start using BBs as a countermeasure. It’s possible yours was commissioned for that very purpose—a fact I think someone may have tried to conceal, judging by the absence of BB-28’s service record. I always found it strange that we were so willing to utilize technology we barely understood. Now we know why. We’ve been aping methods and techniques employed by others from the start. There’s more you should know. It’s about the original Bridge Baby experiments. Piecing together what little I could find, it looks like they started around the time of the Death Stranding. They were conducted on the island of Manhattan off the east coast… which was completely and utterly obliterated by what was almost certainly a voidout. Back then, these experiments had the full support and approval of the American government. It’s all just guesswork, but I suspect the BB program was conceived to help gain a better understanding of the nature of the Death Stranding. However, due to ethical and safety concerns, public opinion was strongly against the program. Still, they pressed on, and in their desperation to make sense of the greatest disaster of their age, I think they caused another I should also mention that the president himself was killed in the blast. It was after his death—when he was succeeded by then Vice President Strand… that the experiments were suspended by executive decree. Documents were shredded, facilities were decommissioned, and every effort was made to pretend that BBs had never even existed. Which begs the question how some random separatist group was capable of resurrecting the tech decades later. I’ll let you know if I turn up anything enlightening.",(via codec) ,N,DeSt-947,DeSt-949

And no distance was too great for us to overcome. Some might call it a kind of telepathy. Divided in body, joined in spirit. We had a Beach just for us. One we shared. Our own “private chiral network,” you might say. With Q-pids, we can build one that will let everyone share what Lockne and I have. I saw it all laid out before me after I signed up with Bridges. A network that could unite everyone, no matter how scattered or different. That would make us whole. It wouldn’t be about bringing people into line. It would be about bringing them into the fold, where they would share and share alike. I knew it could change the world. With Amelie’s help, we finalized the Q-pid design. But after the attack and the birth, everything changed. For the first time in my life, Lockne wasn’t there. But I’m not alone anymore. I can feel her again. She’s close. Thank you, Sam.

It’s… kind of a long story, but he used to conduct field research in the area. My father believed that the key to understanding the Death Stranding was hidden here, somewhere in the caves and strata. But he passed away before he could complete his work. Leaving me to finish what he started. And not long ago, I found something. Something amazing. I was sure it was what my father had been looking for even if I couldn’t see how it related to the Death Stranding myself. What I needed was an expert opinion. Someone who could look at what I’d found and tell me what it meant. So, I grabbed my father’s camera and set out to document my discovery. Took pictures of every last detail… But on the way back, I spotted a group of armed men, and I panicked. Dropped everything and ran like hell. Thankfully, they never saw me. But when I stopped running, I realized the camera was gone, case and all. I’ve been trying to pluck up the courage to go and look for it ever since. But then I remembered that the cargo tag was still on the case. And I figured, you being with Bridges and all that you might have a way to pinpoint its location. Please, I’d give anything to have it back. I’m gonna put in the order. Please understand that camera means everything to me. Until I know it’s safe, can’t think about anything else.

The data stored on it was automatically shared with us after you added the photographer’s shelter to the network along with her father’s research materials. Anyway,my lab still doesn’t have a high-speed chiral connection, but I was able to check one of the images against the database at HQ. Based on my preliminary calculations… and the photographic and documentary evidence in our archives… I would estimate the paintings to be in the region of thirty thousand years old if not older. The artists were likely Neanderthals or other precursors who were migrating across the continent. See the dolphin-like creatures there? At the time the cave would have been situated even farther from the coast than it is now. So how could the artists possibly have encountered dolphins? Answer: They couldn’t. It is my belief that they had a brush not with dolphins, but with beached things. And that would mean the Death Stranding is not the first phenomenon of its kind… That it has happened before. Since the birth of our planet, countless species have gone extinct, from bacteria to dinosaurs. Scientists refer to the largest known mass extinctions as “the Big Five.” But there have, of course, been many other extinction events, albeit on a smaller scale. What if the artists were trying to document one such event? That of their own extinction? It would be the first record in Earth’s history of a Death Stranding. And it would also lend credence to my theories. The sooner you come and connect me to the network, the sooner we’ll know. Just imagine the mysteries we’ll be able to solve.

But our souls -our ""Ka""- have Beaches all their own. These Beaches are given form inside our brains by our beliefs religion, philosophy, and so forth. As a result, a Beach can be anything. And those anythings form a multiverse. However, if many people die at once their Beaches can become entangled, creating a “strand field.” This phenomenon is exacerbated in wartime by omnipresent feelings of resentment and despair. Beaches are more easily and frequently entangled. On such a Beach, exits vanish, and experiences cycle endlessly. Picture it like a record player The needle skips, playing the same phrase again and again. They’re fighting a battle that has no beginning or end. Round and round it goes. Now, the battlefield you visited was in Eastern Europe in World War II. Which is strange, given that the man you encountered—Clifford Unger played no part in that conflict. I can’t explain it.

You can set up the chiral network while I work. Anyway, as it turns out, Sam Bridges, have a favour to ask. A local porter was on his way here with something very valuable, but dropped it en route. It’s a two hundred million year cold ammonite which looks, he says, almost as if it were still alive. He apparently stumbled across it in a boulder field which had previously been hidden beneath a glacier, but… that’s not the half of it. The man claims this ammonite has an umbilical cord—an umbilical cord! Colour me sceptical, but the specimen merits study—and I wasn’t about to leave such delicate work to an amateur. So I asked him to carve out the whole surrounding chunk of rock and bring it here to me. Naturally, I wanted to compare it with contemporary specimens in the vicinity… which is why I had him excavate a number of those in addition to the one he told me about. But what does the dumb fuck go and do? He loses the whole shipment! Didn’t even have the good sense to mark which container had the ammonite with the umbilical cord. The cargo was supposedly lost in the area to the southwest, where toxic gases have a tendency to build up. Ol’ Mr. Reliable claims his cargo scanner is broken and there’s no way he can recover the shipment. But you—you could track it down. To protect you against the fumes, MI provide you with an oxygen mask just to be safe. You can pick it up when you accept the order. That fossil could represent an epochal discovery. While there are examples of viviparous fish, an ammonite with an umbilical cord is unheard of. And if it is indeed 200 million years old, it would also correspond with the end-Triassic extinction. Another one of the Big Five! Could the umbilical cord be connected to the Beach…? We must recover that cargo at all costs. It could provide a vital clue to the mechanisms underpinning the Death Stranding. We’re so close. So very, very close to grasping the true nature of the phenomenon. Hurry, Sam.

Sudden environmental changes such as these invariably lead to the extinction of organisms that fail to adapt. Those that do adapt do so by virtue of ""enhancers""-the regions of DNA that grant successful organisms their advantages. These genetic factors are the key to evolution. But there are genes which have the opposite effect those which disadvantage organisms. … “Extinction factors,” as they have been called. These are the seeds of advancement and obsolescence. Such factors may lie dormant within us all a choice waiting to be made. For every being since the advent of life itself. If so, then ancient proof may hide deep within the tar.

In the distant past, earthquakes caused frictional melting along fault lines, producing layers of what is known as “pseudotachylite.” We call these layers “fossil earthquakes.” Extending the principle, our fissure here is what one might term a “fossil Beach.” The presence of chitralium in this of all strata cannot be a mere coincidence. It strongly suggests that Beaches must have appeared during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. And not just then. The chiral network has recovered data suggesting that similar “fossil Beaches”, were discovered in strata corresponding to other extinction events, too. That would seem to indicate the Big Five and all other major extinctions were accompanied by the appearance of Beaches.

However, he died before they ended. Now, while the circumstances surrounding his death are not entirely clear…. I’m beginning to suspect that these ""battlefields"" of his are at least partially sustained by his enduring emotional attachments. Anger, resentment, regret—I’m pretty sure it’s got something to do with the BB experiments. That much seems clear given his repeated attempts to steal Lou. Cliff seems to be driven by a compulsion to “reclaim” our BB, as if that will make him whole again. A compulsion so powerful that he was not only able to drag himself from the depths of hell, but bring a piece of that hell along with him. One thing’s for sure: he’s nothing like a BT.

DeSt-1719,’til the morning,EPISODE VIII “HEARTMAN”,Deadman," Sam. You’re not going to believe what I’ve found. It’s about the BB experiments. Their true purpose. According to official records, they were continued in secret on the order of President Strand… supposedly with the primary objective of developing BT detectors and preventing voidouts. Any advancements that could be applied to the fields of chiral communications and Beach research were meant to be of purely secondary benefit. But it turns out that’s just a cover story. The truth is, Sam… BBs were originally conceived as catalysts for the operation of the chiral network. They’re integrated into the infrastructure of knot cities for that very reason—every single one you’ve brought into the fold. It was probably Amelie herself who installed them as she moved west with the first expedition, carrying out her mother’s grand plan… making sacrifice after sacrifice on the altar of progress. President Strand told the people what they wanted to hear and did what she thought had to be done. All so America could be whole again. But I’m starting to wonder if it didn’t cost her her soul… The chiral network is our greatest creation. Our proudest achievement… and our guiltiest sin. I don’t know how to feel about it all.

By the way, I’ve made more progress in a certain investigation…. It seems that Clifford Unger willingly put his own child in the care of the scientists conducting the BB experiments… but that he did so completely unaware of their true intentions. This is pure speculation, but I think when Cliff found out about their plans, he attempted to reclaim custody. And after he failed the BB remained in the program’s care. In which case, he would have every reason to bear a grudge towards the president-the woman who allowed it all to happen. Don’t you think? But just because President Strand is dead, doesn’t mean his hate died with her. No, I think he redirected it towards Bridges. Towards you and Amelie and anyone close to the director. And now that hate is driving him to set in motion the Last Stranding—to bring an end to the world as we know it. Why else would Cliff hold Amelie hostage on the Beach? He must know that she’s an EE. There’s no time to lose. You have to save her—and the director. Though I still don’t understand how he managed to travel to her Beach in the first place… There must be more to their relationship.

It’s about the director… So there’s no way he could’ve made the jump to Amelie’s Beach if they didn’t share a strong personal connection, right? Well I looked… and I couldn’t see one. The network should’ve contained something, anything… but there was nothing whatsoever. His entire life prior to his tenure with Bridges has been redacted. His name, his past, everything. There’s no telling who he was. Which led me to consider another possibility. What if it isn’t the director and Amelie who have a connection, but the director and Clifford Unger? And what if that connection is what facilitated the director’s jump to Amelie’s Beach? If it’s those two who have a personal history, then it might explain why Cliff is holding the director hostage as well. But even if that were the case, it doesn’t answer the bigger question… How the hell did the two of them end up on Amelie’s Beach?",(via codec) ,N,DeSt-1728,DeSt-1730
DeSt-1730,’til the morning,EPISODE VIII “HEARTMAN”,Heartman," Sam, Heartman here. There’s something else I’d like you to consider. A guess, albeit an educated one, concerning Cliff’s objective. Somehow, with the aid of the chiral network, our individual Beaches have begun to coalesce, resulting in the formation of a single, massive Seam. Should this process continue, there is a risk that BTs will flood across into our world…. bringing about a Death Stranding on a heretofore unprecedented scale. Now, Clifford Unger’s battlefields and my own Beach appear to be unaffected by this phenomenon, existing entirely in isolation. They do not and have never intersected with others. But what if there were another class of Beach-one that exists on a higher plane—that was responsible for setting this process in motion? And what if the Beach in question were none other than Amelie’s? Cliff may have summoned the director, but I believe his true aim was to seize control of Amelie’s Beach. To exploit its power over every other Beach… and trigger the Last Stranding. It’s the only rational explanation for Cliff’s actions. Which is why you have to stop him.",(via codec) ,N,DeSt-1729,DeSt-1731
DeSt-1731,’til the morning,EPISODE VIII “HEARTMAN”,Deadman," If Heartman’s right, then we’re in serious trouble. Using the chiral network and Amelie’s Beach to trigger the Last Stranding?

With the Last Stranding, he’ll finally have his revenge against the world, that stole his life and his child. You’ve gotta stop him, Sam.

There her “Ka” remained, though her “Ha” came to this world. This division of body and soul forced her to spend most of her childhood in the hospital. But though her health was poor, her DOOMS numbers were off the charts. Her supernatural talents blossomed as she grew older and overcame her limitations. But by the time she was twenty, she could travel to and from the Beach, body and all And that’s where she started spending all of her time. Now, if you wanted to get in touch with Amelie, it was via hologram or nothing The president insisted on that. I swore an oath to the president and to America.

But when the archives were restored, I couldn’t resist testing out my access privileges. And that’s how I found out Bridget was diagnosed with uterine cancer in her twenties, and couldn’t have children. You see? Doesn’t add up, does it? There’s no way Amelie could be Bridget’s biological daughter. So where’d she come from? Who is she? Is she even real? How can we be sure that Amelie is an Extinction Entity… when we don’t even know if Amelie is Amelie? Hell, for all I know the EE theory might be bullshit. But if it’s not—if she’s the cause of the Death Stranding…Then I have to accept her invitation. I’ve loaded my gun with hematic rounds. Sam’s blood. It connects my gun to her, to me, to him.

Don’t have DOOMS. I can’t repatriate like Sam either. Don’t know the first thing about dying. I never tried it. Yeah, I’ve been to hell. Every single battlefield was hell.

A daughter with a debilitating condition and an absent father. “Amelie.” Ame is French for soul. A soul that’s a lie. There was no Amelie. Only me and the Beach.

Which meant that somewhere out beyond it were the memories of time itself, including those of every organism that had ever lived. 4.6 billion years of biological history—a history that might even stretch back to the creation of the universe. The chiral network and everything that followed was born from my pursuit of that knowledge. By passing data through the Beach, we were unbound by the restrictions of time. Simulations that would have taken years or more were simple and effortless. Everything that the Earth had lost and forgotten could be reconstructed and reclaimed. But shortly after we began our research, America saw its first voidout. I thought I was running out of time. That my nightmares were becoming a reality. So I raced to complete the chiral network as quickly as possible. The past held all the answers, if only I could find a way to piece them together. A network that bridged our world and the Beach that might do it, I believed… So I started researching bridge babies: children bound to the world of the dead. What causes an Extinction Entity to come into being? What was the reason for the previous five mass extinctions? The answers to those questions would tell me how to stop the sixth. I founded Bridges, more determined than ever to build a chiral network that would cover all of America. But the longer I fought my war against the inevitable, the weaker I became. My Ha had cancer. The Beach’s punishment, maybe, for not playing along like a good little EE. And then just like that, my Ha was gone. I couldn’t finish what I’d started. So I asked you to do it for me… and you did. You helped us complete the network helped us to reclaim everything the universe experienced from its inception to this moment. Every mystery was ours to solve. Like this one. Once, there was an explosion… A Big Bang that gave birth to time and space. Thing is, it was more like a big fluke. All that matter and antimatter should have cancelled itself out, leaving nothing. But somehow, somehow a tiny speck of matter survived-just enough. Enough to make this world and everything in it. A world that shouldn’t be. A world out of balance. Order inevitably gives way to chaos. Everything that lives must inevitably die. It’s like the universe is trying to return us to the nothing we came from. Maybe the Big Five were its best attempts to finish us off. But somehow, life always managed to survive—just enough. Enough to thumb its nose at the will of the cosmos. You know, I’m starting to think that extinction might be the key to overcoming total annihilation. It forces life to fight to survive. To endure. To exist. That’s why the Big Five ultimately rekindled life instead of extinguishing it. From the ashes of the dead rise the living—stronger and wiser. Inheritors of the legacy of existence itself. They defy the universe and refuse to surrender. They say, “We’re just getting started”. Extinction is an opportunity.",,N,DeSt-1933,DeSt-1935
