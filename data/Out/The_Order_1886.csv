The elixir which heals all wounds and extends the life of natural men. Yet it cannot ensure immortality. Now… Sebastian Malory, once Sir Perceval, is dead. There is a tradition of bestowing a knighthood, in our order, only on the occasion of the death of him who bears that honour and burden. Generation after generation, new knights have taken the names of their hallowed predecessors. We are assembled here today on just such a solemn occasion.
