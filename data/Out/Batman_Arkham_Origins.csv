By now, Gotham P.D. thinks Roman Sionis is dead – the casualty of a turf war. Murdered by The Penguin. But I know better. Someone spooked Sionis’ girlfriend. So he sent her to his safe house… which was anything but safe. Sionis showed up later, ready for trouble… And found it. Or so it seemed. Roman’s always been paranoid. It’s probably why he’s lasted this long. He’d sent in a decoy giving himself the element of surprise… but it wasn’t enough. There was a fight - Sionis lost. The killer didn’t hesitate to shoot the decoy, but he wanted Roman alive - to access the cash stored at the Gotham Merchants Bank. With Sionis under control all that remained was to tie up loose ends. But it wasn’t the fire that killed Sionis’ girlfriend… What kind of monster forces a man to kill the ones he loves..? The Joker.
