Da-1,,,﻿Narrator,"Since the dawn of time, the armies of Heaven and Hell have waged an endless war. Drawn to the conflict was the Charred Council, an entity bound by ancient laws to preserve order and balance. It held that any great power, unchecked, threatened the very fabric of the universe. In time, Heaven and Hell came to honor the Council and its laws, for none were beyond the swift and terrible justice of the Council’s enforcers-- a fearsome brotherhood known as the Four Horsemen. Amid the turmoil, the first humans emerged. The Council foretold that these weak, but cunning creatures would someday be integral to the Balance. Thus, a third kingdom was named the Kingdom of Man. By order of the Council, a truce was forged between Heaven and Hell. The great pact was bound by Seven Seals, to be broken at the appointed time-- when Man’s Kingdom stood ready for the Endwar-- a battle that would bring balance, and determine the ultimate fate of the three kingdoms…",,N,,Da-2

Da-26,,,Judge 3,"The Seven Seals are hidden, as they have been since the pact was forged, eons ago... all of them intact... there was no call. You aided the Dark Ones. Broke a sacred covenant that has doomed Mankind, and threatened the Balance! Do you deny it?",,N,Da-25,Da-27

Da-71,,Over here!,Vulgrim,"These ancient Gates have a mind of their own. But with THIS... you may reach... an understanding. Beyond the gate, seek out Samael’s Prison. Once, Samael was close in power to the Dark Prince himself. Some might even say, a threat. You will find he is no friend to the Destroyer. Seek me out when you’ve gathered more souls. I will make it worth your while...",,N,Da-70,Da-72
Da-72,,Over here!,,[War gets the “Earthcaller” horn and goes to the nearby temple. He blows to the horn and wakes up the “door” of the temple.],,Y,Da-71,Da-73

Da-81,,Over here!,Phantom General," Do you know what is imprisoned here? There are things even YOU should fear, Horseman! Once you were strong. But now you are weak. And you are alone. The Destroyer knows of your coming. Even now, he moves his legions against you!",(laughs) ,N,Da-80,Da-82

Da-85,,Over here!,,[War kills a demon by killing him with his own axe. War begins to solve the puzzle with blood and statues.],,Y,Da-84,Da-86

Da-91,,Over here!,War,Has prison made you a coward?,,N,Da-90,Da-92
Da-92,,Over here!,,[Samael breathes a stream of flame on him. The war hasn’t even moved.],,Y,Da-91,Da-93
Da-93,,Over here!,Samael,"Perhaps there is a way... But, you will need to get inside the Destroyer’s spire. The Tower is guarded by four of his Chosen. Bring me their Hearts. And ask me no questions... My reasons for helping you are my own.",,N,Da-92,Da-94
Da-94,,Over here!,War,Where can I find these Guardians?,,N,Da-93,Da-95
Da-95,,Over here!,Samael,"First, seek the Twilight Cathedral, where the Bat Queen Tiamat has gone to roost. The whole of her domain is a blistered inferno. By land, you will never reach it. Find the high ground... with this. And bring me her still-beating Heart!",,N,Da-94,Da-96
Da-96,,Over here!,,"[War is on its way. In the cemetery, he meets Vulgrim.]",,Y,Da-95,Da-97

Da-102,,Over here!,War,Any curse can be broken.,,N,Da-101,Da-103
Da-103,,Over here!,Gate,Yes... perhaps... These servants of the Destroyer walk unseen within the Realm of Shadow. By their blood we are bound... By their blood shall we be free.,,N,Da-102,Da-104
Da-104,,Over here!,War,I’m no longer move within the Shadow Realm. Much of my power has left me.,,N,Da-103,Da-105
Da-105,,Over here!,Gate,"You need not enter it! I will grant you the power to see into the accursed realm for a time. But, to what end? What hope have we now against the Destroyer’s foul sorcery",,N,Da-104,Da-106

Da-109,,Over here!,Watcher,Find where these Shadow Lurkers hide and KILL THEM ALL! They can’t be that hard to find. Surely this is no challenge for the likes of you? Excellent. I always knew you had it in you. Now THAT was entertaining. Can we do it again?,,N,Da-108,Da-110
