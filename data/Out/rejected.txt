Ar-97: [Using his teleportation ability, the Aragami crosses the passageway jumping over the rubble of rocks and, walking a little ahead, he finds the village. Having ruthlessly slaughtered the Kaiho soldiers, Aragami enter a cemetery, where they see two guards talking to each other).
=====================================
Ar-503: Shadow. Strength. Honor. Leadership. The four symbols of Dakudaga shine on my chest. I’ve been waiting for this moment since the day master Fukuro placed the dark dagger on my upturned palms. Today, as well as giving me his rank and position, he gave me his medallion. I am now one of this great guild’s four leaders. I will follow in my master’s steps with pride.
=====================================
Ar-504: I saw Inari during the ceremony. It’s been ages since we last spoke. We chatted about our adventures – so long ago now, yet it feels like they happened yesterday. He’s probably one of the most trustworthy and honorable men, both on and off the battlefield, that I’ve ever met. Together we made history as one of the best teams Dakudaga had ever seen. He was promoted to a leader of the guild two years ago. He’s always been two steps ahead of me… But now here we are. On equal footing again.
=====================================
Ar-506: Master Fukuro told me about the story of the guild, about how it has all worked for decades.
=====================================
Ar-507: Since it was founded generations ago, Dakudaga has been well known across the continent, almost mythological in status. The best Shadow assassins in the known world stand in our ranks. We are invisible and lethal. Our income depends on the contracts we accept – espionage, theft, assassination. But we always reserve the right to refuse a contract that conflicts or interferes with our interests. This country hasn’t experienced any true internal conflict since Dakudaga was founded, and that’s because the guild itself has cut down any sprout of corruption or tyranny in the government at the very first sign of it.
=====================================
Ar-508: And yet we remain invisible. The shadow lingering by the feet of society. Dakudaga was created to be amorphous and nomadic. We have four leaders who lead the four disparate groups of our guild, each spread around the country ensuring that the organs of power and command do not rot into dictatorship.
=====================================
Ar-509: As long as Dakudaga remains vigilant, peace and stability is assured across the nation. My heart swells with pride at the thought that I am one of this great guild’s four leaders.
=====================================
Ar-511: It turns out paperwork is the great destroyer of a leader’s time. I miss the old days, Inari and I picking routes into impenetrable fortresses, collecting secret information, slitting the throats of our enemies. I miss the vitality. The living.
=====================================
Ar-512: At least now that we’re both leaders of the guild I see more of him than ever.
=====================================
Ar-513: Today after one of our meetings, Inari introduced me to his fiancée, Mitsuki. Their engagement was only announced recently. He told me that she’s a member of the ancient and famous Shirokitsu clan. When she entered the room, it was as if time stopped. That long white hair. Those blue eyes. Like a bright full moon appearing through dark clouds of night.
=====================================
Ar-514: I am ashamed at my thoughts. I must put her out of mind. I won’t be able to look at Inari’s face anymore otherwise. What was he thinking anyway, bringing a woman to the leaders’ meeting?
=====================================
Ar-516: August 21, Year 29 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-518: People like to exaggerate. Still, this guild seems to be causing problems in our neighboring countries. I’ve sent some men to gather information. I don’t think Saigosen would dare set foot on our land, but it never hurts to have an ear to the ground.
=====================================
Ar-520: I could hardly even recognize Inari in the letter. No sign of the ruthless, sharp, and cunning man I once knew. Perhaps he is under the same enchantment I felt when I saw Mitsuki. That sensation of safety and invincibility she exudes. Not something I’d want, personally. I’d never abandon my post for such banal reasons.
=====================================
Ar-522: August 1, Year 33 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-523: Four years after their first appearance, Saigosen has decided to cross our borders without permission. I can’t understand why they would dare to do this. Maybe all the time they spent assaulting and killing farmers has made them feel invincible. We’ll show them what happens when you stir up the hornet’s nest.
=====================================
Ar-524: It took longer to travel to the Saigosen camp than it took to win the entire war. The night after we found them, we broke into their leaders’ tents and put an end to their lives. I didn’t expect a long battle, but this was just disappointing. “Two great brothers of Light,” they said, “who from great distance can blind you and pierce your heart in the blink of an eye…” I actually expected something from them. But it was barely worth coming. Certainly not two of us with our best soldiers.
=====================================
Ar-525: I’m sure Inari was glad when we said he could stay at home with his beloved wife and daughter… The old Inari wouldn’t be happy unless his sword was the first to taste our prey’s blood.
=====================================
Ar-527: January 9, Year 34 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-528: I’ve never felt this before. A sense of… of shortcoming. Of failure. I’ve never felt anger like it, as though my insides have been clawed out. A burning anger remains. I’ve lost friends in the line of duty many times, I thought I was used to it...
=====================================
Ar-529: The Saigosen leaders killed Inari three days ago. They also killed Mitsuki… and Yamiko. Our sources confirm that the Light adepts didn’t leave a shred of their bodies intact. Wiped from existence in the blink of an eye, our sources say. The Light soldiers also attacked most of the village. How could Inari let this happen? My most trusted agent reported that the Saigosen leaders were present during celebrations at their capital… They made us believe we had killed them, that they had surrendered… Perhaps the Saigosen are something else after all. A true nemesis.
=====================================
Ar-530: But why Inari? Why his family? Was he just the first? Is this an open declaration of war?
=====================================
Ar-531: I told Inari to bring his family here, to our largest encampment… I told him, but he didn’t want his daughter to grow up in a place like this. He should have listened to me.
=====================================
Ar-533: May 28, Year 37 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-534: Thirty-eight months have passed since the day we began our expedition to Rashomon Valley where Inari and Mitsuki lived. Each and every day I imagine myself making the Light brothers suffer. Making them pay for what they did. But now that we’re finally here, it’s empty – the death of our spies during the attack filled us with more trepidation than usual. We had no insight into what we would find.
=====================================
Ar-536: March 14, Year 39 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-537: We examined the strange minerals further. I can safely say that this mineral was Saigosen’s reason for attacking Inari’s village. They could have struck anywhere else after their strike, but they didn’t. They disappeared into the wilderness immediately after the attack. We have yet to find anything that would indicate their whereabouts.
=====================================
Ar-538: We’ve taken a fishing village east of the Great Forest and south of Sanzen Kozui Lake. Some villagers seem to know about Saigosen, but refuse to say anything. We’ll need to persuade them.
=====================================
Ar-540: March 18, Year 39 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-541: Sometimes I wonder whether someone or something really is in charge of our destinies.
=====================================
Ar-543: I seized the villager and demanded to know where he had found it. He said it was on the ground in the middle of the forest. I dragged the man back to my office and wringed every last drop of information I could out of him. This is the only clue we’ve had about Inari’s family for years. Perhaps one of them survived after escaping in the forest?
=====================================
Ar-544: Then the real wonder. The real coincidence. The person I wasn’t sure even existed, the person who had survived Inari’s name, found me. While I held a candle to the man’s face, a small creature leaped from the shadows armed with a knife. It struck like lightning, almost catching me unguarded. As it threw a flurry of attacks at me, I eventually managed to get a good look at its white hair, which shone with the light of the rising sun. It didn’t stop swinging until the moment I Shadow leaped behind it. Then it stopped and stared at me with those blue eyes... The same impression I had years ago of those eyes piercing through my very soul traveled down my spine once again.
=====================================
Ar-546: I struggle to think of the last time I was this amazed – this delighted – by life’s surprises.
=====================================
Ar-547: That little girl, dressed in a rough coat made of fur and armed with a knife made from the bone of a beast, was the living picture of Mitsuki. With all the peace and friendliness I could muster, I said, “Yamiko?” For a moment her eyes widened, but she quickly recovered herself, stepped away, and raised her guard, growling at me like an animal. I was taken aback too. I realized that in front of me was a child who had spent five years alone in the Great Forest of Rashomon – probably after watching Saigosen Light adepts kill her parents… I’m almost certain she had avoided human contact since then. Perhaps she didn’t understand words anymore. But if she had avoided humans, I wondered, why had she attacked me in the village?
=====================================
Ar-548: The answer, rather obviously, was the doll. I slowly took it out of my pocket and placed my sword on the ground. The little girl stared at the doll without blinking. Then, I took my Dakudaga pendant with my other hand and put it by the doll’s side. It worked. Showing the little girl the Dakudaga symbol on both objects stopped her in her tracks. She lowered her knife slowly. I Shadow leaped to her side and gave her the doll. That stare she gave me... I promised to myself that I would protect her with my life for the rest of my days.
=====================================
Ar-550: In the end, the only clue we found about Saigosen is that they fled to the south after striking Inari’s village. Not much to go on, but at least fate rewarded us with Yamiko, who survived their attack somehow. We decided to go back to our new base of operations in the city of Kyuryu. We have called off our search for Saigosen… for now.
=====================================
Ar-551: Children can be challenging. Yamiko is difficult with everyone in the clan except me. I’m a Shadow assassin, not a nanny! At least Yamiko is gifted. She is far from normal, displaying skills with stealth and Shadow essence already on par with those of my best men. It has made things easier in her training, but other aspects of her education have been far more challenging. I’m just glad we found her before it was too late. Before her mind had lost all semblance of humanity.
=====================================
Ar-552: Somehow we have given Yamiko a place in society again as a member of Dakudaga. Since arriving here with us, her skills have improved considerably. She has even begun behaving like a human being again. I’m certain we shall be presenting her with the dark dagger in no time. She will be one of our greatest agents.
=====================================
Ar-554: Yamiko is the fourth woman to ever enter Dakudaga’s ranks. And among the few female members, she is also the youngest. Some of my men find it hard to swallow, especially the ones that Yamiko beat to the dark dagger ceremony. The worst thing is when they try to hurt her – physically and mentally. They end up either unconscious or in pain for days. Over and over again. I can’t help but laugh. In Dakudaga, it doesn’t matter who you are, but what you can do. She is testament to that fact.
=====================================
Ar-556: It is my duty as a leader to be impartial about all of my soldiers… but that isn’t easy with three truly special students under your wing.
=====================================
Ar-558: Yamiko turned sixteen today. I can see Inari’s will behind her eyes, but on the outside… every day she reminds me more of her mother. I realized last week that she has become a woman. It was one of those fleeting moments when you see something or someone familiar in a completely new light, as though you’d never seen them before.
=====================================
Ar-559: Today, she, Orochi, and Ryuta were presented with a medal etched with their team’s crest in honor of their great work during these past few years. They have carried out every contract with unprecedented efficiency, conviction, and talent. When I gave Yamiko her medal and she looked at me… I felt the same feeling of protection, of safety, that I felt all those years ago when I first saw her mother. I shivered. Hopefully not visibly.
=====================================
Ar-560: I don’t know how to assimilate this feeling. I heard, a long time ago, that certain women of the Shirokitsu clan were gifted with a great power. A power of command. Yamiko’s mother hailed from Shirokitsu. I’ve always been skeptical about legends like these, but Yamiko’s effect is just too powerful. It can’t be anything else. She’s like a daughter to me.
=====================================
Ar-561: Yamiko’s team is the best. The best under my command at the moment. The best I have ever seen. Their teamwork has become perfect, a flawless self-sustaining machine. Sometimes I catch a glimpse of her true power, and it is terrifying. She could be more powerful than I am. We must be careful with her. Normally an adept finds their limits after they come of age, and their power level stabilizes. That day has yet to come for Yamiko.
=====================================
Ar-563: March 1, Year 47 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-564: At last. Our spies have found them. We received a message detailing the location of the Saigosen guild’s capital. Far south, north of the arid lands, a fortress city was spotted flying the Saigosen flag. Spies infiltrated the fortress and found the base of their power. Their leaders, their resources, their plans.
=====================================
Ar-565: While waiting for the winter’s end, the other three leaders and I have been preparing a full reconnaissance mission with our best teams. We need to know what the Saigosen have been preparing all these years. After we found Yamiko, our best scientific minds discovered that the mineral Saigosen extracted from the mines near Inari’s home had some kind of compatibility with Light essence. We have to expect the unexpected.
=====================================
Ar-568: April 18, Year 47 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-569: I am struggling to believe what I have seen. An unbelievable sight, an unbelievable fact.
=====================================
Ar-570: The recon mission was going well. We got all the information we needed to plan an attack, and we were preparing to leave. At the agreed time, all the teams gathered at the meeting spot in the forest outside the city gates… except Yamiko’s.
=====================================
Ar-571: Every minute we waited for her, Ryuta, and Orochi was torture. If Yamiko found out that she was in Saigosen’s headquarters, she would lose her mind. If she decided to fight – which she would – she’d sabotage our only good chance at crippling Saigosen for good, as well as putting herself in great danger. The Light mechanisms they had developed, the defenses we saw, made them far more dangerous than any force we knew of.
=====================================
Ar-572: Suddenly, a loud explosion echoed across the sky. The top floor of the castle at the heart of the fortress burst into flames while we stared, mouths agape. We jumped onto the guard towers to get a better look, and what we saw left us even more speechless than before.
=====================================
Ar-573: Something was moving at high speed through the fortress, avoiding the Saigosen soldiers’ attacks before destroying each and every one of them with huge, sweeping blades of darkness. Within minutes, the figure shrouded in a dark fog had destroyed the entire fortress. Eventually silence fell, and the shape made for us.
=====================================
Ar-574: Unable to say a word, we waited for the door to open. To see what kind of monster would be our certain end. The door opened slowly, and emerging from the impenetrable shroud of shadow was Yamiko’s silhouette.
=====================================
Ar-576: April 18, Year 47 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-578: April 19, Year 47 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-579: Yamiko woke up this morning after being unconscious for two days. I finally asked her what had happened. As I’d feared, she had realized she was in Saigosen’s fortress, and was overcome with vengeance. Saigosen’s leaders had a secret weapon – a new defensive device – that allowed them to kill Orochi and Ryuta effortlessly. Just as they activated the device, empowering themselves tenfold, Yamiko’s sheer anger awakened the evidently bottomless well of latent power within her.
=====================================
Ar-580: We have to proceed carefully. This situation will be difficult. Saigosen is no more, but now we must work out what to do with Yamiko, as half of Dakudaga now consider her a goddess.
=====================================
Ar-582: June 9, Year 47 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-583: We, the four leaders, spent an entire week discussing what to do with Yamiko. She hasn’t come to terms with her friends’ deaths yet, and spends hours in their mausoleums. Meanwhile, people who were affected by Saigosen’s oppression and assaults, entire brotherhoods of Shadow, keep visiting our city’s doors, offering thanks to the “goddess” who freed them. It’s only a matter of time before this rumor about the “goddess” reaches other countries.
=====================================
Ar-584: I tried to convince the other leaders that we must take hold of the situation. Dakudaga has always watched over this country and its government from the shadows... but now there is a power vacuum. We ourselves can seize government, especially now that we can no longer live in the shadows with Yamiko drawing attention like a dark sun. Hordes of people come to our gates every day. This could be the beginning of an empire, for better or worse. The city of Kyuryu is practically a fortress already. It could be our headquarters. And our biggest threat, Saigosen, was destroyed two months ago. We can grow strong without anyone to contest our reign. Just picturing our power makes me shiver.
=====================================
Ar-585: If we did this, we wouldn’t be Dakudaga anymore. We would be Yamiko’s empire. The empire of the Shadow Empress. We would be an eternal night, in place to protect those afflicted by the cruel forces of Light. We would be Nisshoku.
=====================================
Ar-587: June 27, Year 1 of the Sixth Age
=====================================
Ar-588: I’ve managed to help Yamiko see things from my perspective. We have within arm’s reach the power to prevent anyone suffering like she did every again. No more arrogant Light brotherhoods to take advantage of Shadow followers, like they have for generations. Yamiko has agreed to be our empress, but she’s so young. She doesn’t have the knowledge or the experience necessary to rule. For this reason, we have agreed that I’ll be her right hand. I’ll stand by her side and give her my counsel.
=====================================
Ar-589: A new age begins. The age of the Shadow Empress.
=====================================
Ar-590: July 4, Year 1 of the Sixth Age
=====================================
Ar-591: We’ve declared ourselves the sect of Nisshoku. Our ruler, the Shadow Empress. Two of Dakudaga’s other leaders have also agreed to become councilors for the Empress. The third leader… has abandoned us. A traitor. The country’s governor sent a letter describing his displeasure with our actions. Dakudaga was the largest military force in the land, and for the most part it has transformed into Nisshoku. If the government has something to say, we will wait with bated breath.
=====================================
Ar-593: Fortune, fame, and power. Since the birth of Nisshoku, these three roots of success haven’t stopped growing and becoming stronger, feeding us with their nectar. One of our biggest concerns in the beginning was keeping watch for any potential Light brotherhoods looking for revenge. I myself led some of the recon missions, but what we found was harmless, almost absurd. The only one that was of note was based in the arid lands. Peasants who were incredibly skillful with Light essence. But they were peaceful cowards, without a single theory on combat. It almost made me laugh to learn they were pacifists.
=====================================
Ar-594: Yamiko turns 22 today. We let the citizens come into the temple grounds to honor her name in celebration. Her image, standing there in front of hundreds of people worshipping her, is always inspiring. She looks so imposing, so powerful… yet still so sad. I wonder what she is feeling inside. I keep asking her if she’s happy to be our empress, and she says she is fine. I think a part of her died when Orochi and Ryuta were taken from us. I wonder if I’ll be able to make her happy again.
=====================================
Ar-596: June 28, Year 9 of the Sixth Age
=====================================
Ar-597: A rumor gave me pause today. One of our spies – in the guise of a friendly merchant traveling south with eastern pottery – said he saw unusual activity in a southern brotherhood. Named Kaiho, they were growing in number and gaining strength day by day. The brotherhood is mainly composed of Light adepts, but masters of all essences are in their ranks, from Shadow to Fire. The spy said they might even be planning an attack, the movements seemed so organized. The lips of their adepts were tightly sealed.
=====================================
Ar-598: I told one of the other councilors about my concerns, but he laughed it off. He said that Nisshoku is so huge and magnificent that they couldn’t even see it from their tiny territory. Like a fly attacking a bear. Even if they had some strength, we have the Shadow Empress on our side. He’s right, of course.
=====================================
Ar-600: May 30, Year 10 of the Sixth Age
=====================================
Ar-601: They were smart. My commanders’ pursed lips when we met this morning made it clear that we have been outwitted. The upstart Kaiho brotherhood crippled villages and towns along our key supply routes and sabotaged our barracks and recruitment bases – less than a year after we were made aware of their existence.
=====================================
Ar-602: This city is a fortress. Normally I wouldn’t be worried about an upstart brotherhood who had gained some numbers, but this isn’t just one brotherhood – this is a myriad of them. Light adepts, Fire adepts, Life adepts… The biggest problem is the Earth adepts. My spies tell me they’re positioned at the rear of the Kaiho army. They're planning to send shockwaves beneath the battlefield to undermine the foundations of our walls. Our fortifications don’t stand a chance against this.
=====================================
Ar-603: Flow and adapt. The field of battle is the vessel – you must be the water. I have decided the best approach is to bring the fight to their vanguard. We must leave the city walls and face them. The Shadow Empress will be our last resort.
=====================================
Ar-605: June 4, Year 10 of the Sixth Age
=====================================
Ar-606: They did it. They were more powerful than we knew. They didn’t even show a hint of their true power until now. My limbs tingle with anger. Anger at what they did to her.
=====================================
Ar-607: We were losing. Earth essence attacks battered the city’s outer walls. Our men were pushed back to the limits. There was only one thing for it. I called her. She emerged from the city gates to end the cowards. But Kaiho’s four leaders, the most powerful masters in their army, were waiting for her. They pressed the Empress back into the city. Cornered her.
=====================================
Ar-608: But they were waiting for something. They were holding back. Then I saw him, the old man. They called his name – Tsuyoshi. He was making straight for Yamiko. I intercepted him, but before I could land a single strike his hand rose and my limbs failed me. My energy drained away like water from a sliced bamboo shoot. The leaders pressed Yamiko back to her temple, and the old man turned his attention to her – I watched the vitality leave her face. I saw my chance, and plunged my blade deep into his flank. As he fell, he grasped my arm just above my sword hand... I’ll never forget the pain. A thousand fires burned from his fingers. I fell with him.
=====================================
Ar-611: June 12, Year 10 of the Sixth Age
=====================================
Ar-612: My men tell me that the Empress isn’t dead. She is being held captive by the Kaiho in… in our old capital. In Kyuryu. They have used a rare technique to entrap her. Apparently she is catatonic, unresponsive. As if her soul itself had been captured, not just her body. I don’t know what this means, but in any case she is clearly past the point of helping herself. We will have to look for an opportunity.
=====================================
Ar-613: The old man must have helped them learn this technique. Curse the fool. My muscles still twitch where he touched me that day. I can barely hold a sword. I don’t think the aching in my bones will ever heal.
=====================================
Ar-614: May 30, Year 12 of the Sixth Age
=====================================
Ar-615: An enormous, disgusting building has been built in honor of Kaiho’s dead. Well, there is a place for Nisshoku’s fallen too… In the catacombs.
=====================================
Ar-616: To commemorate the anniversary of their victory, they have activated some infernal Light device which casts an endless beam of light into the sky. Curse them. We will have our revenge. My men train every day. Our camp slowly grows. We will avenge or even, if we can, free the Empress.
=====================================
Ar-618: March 15, Year 15 of the Sixth Age
=====================================
Ar-619: Finally. One of our new spies, established in the thick of the Kaiho nation, met with success. He managed to read a private letter between two senior Kaiho captains. It doesn’t detail the technique they used to imprison her, but it mentions the technique’s side effects. Each of the three remaining Kaiho leaders are bound by some sort of affliction. One of them in particular – Yuki – can barely stand it. They say he has become weaker and weaker ever since they captured the Empress. He has to be our target.
=====================================
Ar-620: This week the leaders are meeting to perform some sort of ritual. This could be our moment to attack. Perhaps we can find out how they are holding the Empress captive. We need to get her back. I won’t let this chance slip away.
=====================================
Ar-622: May 20, Year 27 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-623: The “Vital Essence,” or simply “essence,” is what we call the energy that flows inside any living being, just like blood. I’ve studied it for so many years, and yet so much is still unknown.
=====================================
Ar-624: In the same way that the heart pumps red sap through our veins, essence also has a circulatory system and a center, although it is more like a river than a pump. It generates its own motion, it generates its own existence. That center, as well as the essence, is known by many names depending on where in the world you are, but here we call it the soul.
=====================================
Ar-630: April 6, Year 45 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-631: As I said, the soul is a canvas you can paint with whichever element you want. You learn how to assimilate an element from the environment, you blend your soul’s essence with it, and you emit the result in the form of a technique.
=====================================
Ar-632: But what if you cast your essence without channeling it into an element first? This was the question which led to the discovery of Life essence. Life is the only element you can summon from within yourself, and it is still the most challenging to master.
=====================================
Ar-633: We, the five sages, have decided to study this great essence together. Each of us are entering this endeavor as Masters. Now it is time to combine our efforts, discover how far we can push the limits, and document the results. We plan to found our own brotherhood. Eventually, we might even begin teaching its use. A bright future awaits… I hope.
=====================================
Ar-635: May 10, Year 45 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-636: The old manuscripts tell us there’s a delicate synergy between body and soul... Surely breaking this balance means defying nature itself. What would happen, then, to a body containing more “soul” than it should? Indeed, what would happen if the soul was divided or shattered? As far as we know, these questions have never been asked. Until now.
=====================================
Ar-637: The soul transferring technique, which we are the first to develop, creates a link between the summoner’s soul and the target’s. The summoner can transfer part of their soul to the target, or vice versa. Receiving a part of a soul leads to an increase in your Life essence, which means an initial boost of power. Furthermore, since the other person’s essence has been merged with your own, it immediately becomes possible to channel elements your target was attuned to.
=====================================
Ar-638: The challenge is that sustaining this link is exhausting. We’ve experienced different symptoms after short periods of usage, but it seems that once cancelled, the technique returns everything to the way it was and there are no consequences. Still, this marks a great advance in our research. I wonder what the next step will reveal.
=====================================
Ar-640: July 21, Year 45 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-641: Something strange happened today. A man from the village nearby came asking for help. He said a lunatic, a powerful Fire adept, keeps coming to his village and attacking its people and cattle, apparently for no reason.
=====================================
Ar-642: We can’t stand by and let this happen.
=====================================
Ar-643: August 17, Year 45 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-644: The next time the mad Fire adept emerged to attack, we were waiting for him. He was powerful indeed. Some cultures form entire sects around adepts who hold such power and follow them like gods. Luckily this man had no sect.
=====================================
Ar-645: It was pointless parleying with him. He attacked on sight, a frenzy behind his eyes. It wasn’t long before our battle began to damage the town – then we came up with an idea. One of us held guard, while two others used the soul transferring technique on the man – but this time we did it inversely, taking part of his soul.
=====================================
Ar-647: Another powerful use for Life essence has revealed itself to us… And now of course we will never go hungry. The villagers shower us with offerings.
=====================================
Ar-649: August 20, Year 45 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-650: It was clear that the soul transfer technique was a powerful tool for weakening enemies. Nevertheless, a substantial drawback is that the summoner needs to stay perfectly still and very focused, otherwise the link will break and the technique will be cancelled... We must experiment further.
=====================================
Ar-651: We’ve done it! I myself performed the experiment with one of the other masters. We broke the Life link while the transfer technique was active, locking a small part of his soul in my body. The very instant it was sealed within me, I felt his essence emanating through my chest and limbs. The limits of my power have increased, and conversely his have decreased proportionately, as with the soul transferring technique. What is different here is that this transfer now lasts until I make a link between us, unsealing his soul from within me. We have decided to stay like this for a few hours and document any effects in the short term. This could be a revolution!
=====================================
Ar-653: Two days have passed, and the seal persists. It has taken so little time to gather so much important data.
=====================================
Ar-655: Last night I heard my partner’s screams while I slept. I woke with a start, thinking the nightmare was in my own mind. The second time his scream reached me I rushed to his room immediately.
=====================================
Ar-656: He was lying on his bed, asleep. Evidently uncomfortable, but not in any pain. I realized nobody else had heard him. Then another scream, louder than the others. Covering my ears didn’t help.
=====================================
Ar-657: I woke him, and the screaming stopped. He was having a nightmare. I could hear his dreams.
=====================================
Ar-659: October 5, Year 45 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-661: The downside is that the research has revealed more side effects, which vary depending on the subject, but seem to show common signs depending on how the technique has affected your soul. If part of your soul was transferred to someone else, you present certain side effects; if part of someone else’s soul was sealed with yours, you present different ones. The technique’s strengths and weaknesses both disappear once the connection is cut and the soul fragments are returned to their owners.
=====================================
Ar-662: We keep iterating the process, resting between longer transfer sessions. Having your soul shattered, corrupted by another, certainly impacts the physical body. A sort of stress on the fibers of your being. Accumulating too much of this could be dangerous.
=====================================
Ar-664: We conceived of this technique as a tool to weaken dangerous enemies indefinitely. Yet after two months, we are still discovering new uses for it.
=====================================
Ar-665: Once part of somebody else’s soul is sealed with yours, it’s possible to transfer this fragment to yet another subject. All of it, or just part. This means that it’s possible for the summoner to lighten the burden of the foreign soul. Lighten the malaise. This clearly made a difference when we tested it. The stress was the technique’s main drawback.
=====================================
Ar-666: It also means that a soul can be split into more than two parts. Depending on the summoner’s capabilities, the other person’s soul can be fragmented into as many parts as the summoner wishes.
=====================================
Ar-667: I’ve left the best for last. We have discovered that it’s possible to seal soul parts not only in humans, but in animals too. Although they cannot carry as much soul as a human body, the link works in exactly the same way. Some of us have now begun documenting how it feels to see the world as a rat, or a dog...
=====================================
Ar-669: Fascinating. Utterly fascinating.
=====================================
Ar-670: Yesterday morning we found Sohtho, our dog, dead. I sealed part of his soul within me a week ago. This is unprecedented. While I’m certain he didn’t die from natural causes or any external injuries, the cause still remains unclear.
=====================================
Ar-671: Then I realized this was the first time we’d had the opportunity to observe any interactions between the sealing technique and death. When Sohtho died, his soul should have left his body and become one with nature, as it has since the beginning of time. But the part of his soul that I took was still there, sealed within me. I could feel it. Does this mean his soul couldn’t leave the world of the living? Was he trapped on this mortal coil?
=====================================
Ar-672: Then I had one of the most drastic ideas I’ve had in my life. Using the unbreakable connection between parts of a being’s soul, I commanded Sohtho’s other soul part, the main one, to return to me. Once it drew near – who knows where from – I directed it telepathically into Sohtho’s body. We all watched, speechless, as Sohtho’s body stood up and started running around the room.
=====================================
Ar-674: Despite what we did with Sohtho, we have not been able to progress further. It is impossible without harming animals, and we aren’t here for that. Hopefully we’ll find a method in time.
=====================================
Ar-675: Besides that, however, we’ve made another amazing discovery. Animals are now forbidden, but it has transpired that soul fragments can be sealed in objects. Until now we thought that soul transference required a soul on both sides of the transaction – but once again our research has borne new marvels.
=====================================
Ar-676: A shortcoming of this technique is that we can’t seal a soul fragment in any random object. It seems to be more complex than that. The summoner needs to have a strong sentimental connection with the object of transference. Precisely how this relationship works is still a mystery to us, but we can guess that a channel for Life essence is built within any object of someone’s affection. The size of the fragment you can transfer is far smaller than that of animals, but unlike animals an inanimate object doesn’t die naturally… Based on previous studies, an adept who could seal small parts of his soul into objects like this would be immortal as long as someone was available to put his soul back into his body…
=====================================
Ar-677: Maybe we are not far away from the path to immortality after all.
=====================================
Ar-679: April 6, Year 46 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-680: It’s been a year since we five sages came together to study Life essence. Now we are known as “The Sealing Brotherhood.” So many adepts came asking for apprenticeships, and eventually we decided that it’s time to accept one. His name is Maelsha. He has a pure heart and shows great potential for using Life essence.
=====================================
Ar-681: April 28, Year 46 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-682: Maelsha is doing well. In just a few weeks he has begun using the sealing technique, which is advanced. At this rate, I am certain he will become a sage, an heir to our order. The first of a brand new generation.
=====================================
Ar-683: May 25, Year 46 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-684: Lately, Maelsha has begun making simple mistakes – even in basic routines and drills. Something is interfering with his concentration. He says he will come back stronger, but I’m worried something is truly wrong.
=====================================
Ar-685: May 29, Year 46 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-686: Apparently Maelsha abandoned his training for the last three days because of a love affair. We don’t tolerate this, but we have been forced to go easier on Maelsha than we usually would. The woman he has loved for many years has a very rare disease. I’ve decided to visit him before he does something he regrets. He is fully aware of the power of the Life essence.
=====================================
Ar-688: May 26, Year 46 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-689: I was right. In disgrace, I was right. By the time I reached Maelsha’s home it was too late.
=====================================
Ar-690: His beloved must have been on her deathbed. He tried to retain her soul using the sealing technique, but his body couldn’t withstand it. It was foolish to show him such an advanced and perilous technique in the first months of his training. I’m certain he was well aware of the risks, and did it with the best of intentions, but now… now his death weighs heavily on our shoulders.
=====================================
Ar-692: Maelsha always wanted to visit the arid lands. Maybe that’s a good place for a new start.
=====================================
Ar-694: August 23, Year 46 of the Fifth Age
=====================================
Ar-695: I arrived in the arid lands some weeks ago. Rumors were right about the weather. I have never sweated so much – and never completely run out of sweat – like I have here. Luckily I found a good place to live. Up in the mountains, situated not far from a small village full of Light adepts. The way they use Light in their worship is inspiring… Whenever I feel a particular longing for human contact, I’ll go visit them.
=====================================
Ar-696: With everything that has happened... the forbidden technique, Sohtho, Maelsha… I can’t stop thinking about reincarnation. I’ve heard so much superstition about it from so many different cultures, but never actual facts or methods. We never even thought of looking into it further. It was nothing but a fantasy... and then I saw Sohtho come back to life. The gap where his soul should be filled up again like a goblet at a feast. He recognized us too, just like before. What would have happened if I had put the dog’s soul into a different body? Would he still have been able to recognize us? Probably not – memories lie in the brain, not the soul itself… But does the soul carry an imprint of its body, of the body’s memories? Are they etched into the soul like stains in glass? If I had put a different soul into the dog’s corpse, would Sohtho still be Sohtho? I don’t think so. The soul is an important part of our identity.
=====================================
Ar-697: I just wonder... What if I put Maelsha’s soul into another body? Would he himself be present in the body, living or dead? Would he come back?
=====================================
Ar-699: I’ve been taking care of a bird’s egg I found on the ground. It must have been knocked out of a nest. A miracle it survived. Today it cracked and a raven chick emerged. Perhaps this will help make my days slightly less lonely. I think I’ll name him Kibo.
=====================================
Ar-700: At last I made contact with the people in the village, albeit in a rather unexpected way. A few days ago on the way back to my camp, I heard some children. They seemed worried, so I decided to approach them. It turned out that one of them had injured his leg. I healed him without a second thought. Of course, to these villagers Life essence is completely newfangled. The expression on their faces when the child stood up as if nothing had happened… It’s been a while since I actually had fun with something.
=====================================
Ar-701: I helped them back to their homes. Since then, the villagers have allowed me within their walls whenever I want. It’s rare to find sects like this one, both peaceful and with great skill in an element.
=====================================
Ar-702: I have to leave for a while. My partners contacted me using their soul fragments. They talked of a sect called Nisshoku, of great numbers ruled by an empress. Apparently she is considered a goddess. Nisshoku are sweeping through the land, massacring many. My command of Life is needed. The other sages believe this is the beginning of a new era...
=====================================
Ar-704: Everything was easier back then. All we had to worry about were the ceremonies held for Amaterasu, our Sun Goddess. Our only contact with the outside world was the merchants who stopped by our gates from time to time. The gates of that isolated village out near the mountains.
=====================================
Ar-705: I used to wonder how it would feel to travel the world, learn about different cultures, meet people adept in different essences… We used to grab adventure where we could. The four of us used to sneak out, climb the blacksmith’s hut, and hop down the other side of the village walls. A drip of adventure that would quench our thirst for days. Our parents always found out, of course. And we were always punished. But it was worth it.
=====================================
Ar-706: My father used to say that as you get older the lure of adventure ebbs away. That you begin to appreciate what you have in front of your nose, rather than what’s beyond the horizon. I never relished that thought as a child. But I could never have predicted the appearance of Master Tsuyoshi. Or how much he would change everything.
=====================================
Ar-708: I remember it as if it were yesterday. We’d played outside too late and were rushing back home, making a game of it. Hikaru tried to leap over a pile of rocks, but didn’t make the jump. We saw his leg slip through the rubble, heard his leg crunch. We watched him turn whiter than the moon. We tried to get him out, but he almost fainted from the pain. It was nearly night time. We had never stayed out beyond the village walls that late before. We heard tell of desert creatures who would drag you back to their lairs – vicious giant birds and scorpions with huge tails like scythes.
=====================================
Ar-709: Then it appeared. A tall figure with a long beard and green vestments, holding a staff and walking slowly toward us. Our blood froze. By the time we noticed the shape, it was already at Hikaru’s side, pointing its withered staff at the wrenched leg. It said in a calm voice, breaking a long silence, “Stand up.”
=====================================
Ar-710: I got a closer look at the person while he addressed Hikaru. The figure was an old man, and he wasn’t scary at all. In fact, he emanated an aura of utter tranquility. We almost didn’t notice when Hikaru stood up as if nothing had happened to his leg. The four of us were staring at the old man. With a kind smile, he broke the silence again and said, “Shall I take you home?”
=====================================
Ar-712: Master Tsuyoshi’s arrival in our village was disruptive. We hadn’t had an outsider stay with us for decades. Having a stranger in our midst, and one who wasn’t a Light adept, put everyone on edge. He was granted entry, but almost everyone just tried to avoid him… the same way they avoided everything new and different. But Master Tsuyoshi never took offense. He just focused on our rituals and studied our Light practices, which he found fascinating. The Master said he had been living in the mountains nearby, not far from where he had found us on our doomed adventure. It was part of his pilgrimage, he said.
=====================================
Ar-714: We enjoyed Master Tsuyoshi’s company for a long time. Eventually, he said he had to return to his guild – they needed him for an assignment. He left us a stronger clan than we were before. Wiser, more capable. It felt like we could handle anything.
=====================================
Ar-716: Two months after Master Tsuyoshi’s departure, a group of around thirty men appeared. Their leader said they were humble nomads crossing the steppe. They wanted to stop for provisions, offered us trade... Before Master Tsuyoshi came, the village would never have accepted trade with strangers like that, but now things were different.
=====================================
Ar-717: They attacked the moment they realized we didn’t use Light essence for combat. It was the third night after they arrived. A massacre ensued. My people didn’t stand a chance. Hikaru, Ryo, Sora, and I were outside during the attack, on one of our escapades. We ran back the moment we saw the smoke… Until we heard the screams.
=====================================
Ar-718: And then we saw him, beneath the Nisshoku flag. The man with the patch over one eye. His sword dripping with blood. His face impassive but for a slight tug at the corners of his lips. He noticed us immediately and commanded a man to come and kill us. We tried to escape, but the man cast shadows ahead of himself and slipped through them, reaching us in seconds.
=====================================
Ar-720: As the commander’s henchman reached for Hikaru, Sora shut her eyes and cast a Light barrier around us. We’d never applied Light essence in combat before, but it only took Sora’s sharp mind a moment to seize the opportunity. Then our pursuer began to laugh... He knew her barrier would save us for a few seconds at most.
=====================================
Ar-721: But just as the barrier began to fade, Ryo struck at the man with all his soul. We’d never seen anything like it. He threw a powerful flash which sent the man reeling backwards, and gave us time to start running.
=====================================
Ar-722: We survived. He couldn’t have recovered before we made it to the forest. But now we were alone, in the middle of a vast emptiness. The mountain and the village were the only places we knew in the entire world. At first we felt… an emptiness. After days – painful days – of trudging on in silence, the emptiness gave way to melancholy. We sobbed. We were the clan’s only survivors. Hikaru’s sorrow came out in boar-like grunting and groaning. Sora would stay silent for hours, then unleash a single, long scream like a banshee. Ryo’s face turned bright red and his features twisted into a permanent, silent grimace.
=====================================
Ar-723: Ultimately, however, the melancholy soured… into thirst. A thirst for revenge. They were all dead. We alone bore the clan’s name. We would work together to do to these men what they had done to us.
=====================================
Ar-725: Ryo saved us. We might have died in that desert had it not been for him. He helped us see that we had potential within us, a potential none of us had seen until that point. He recalled what he had seen in Sora and himself that night, when we were on the cusp of death. We knew how to use Light essence. We just had to think laterally, to apply our thinking to battle instead of faith and tilling soil. We talked about retaking our home. We thought that perhaps some of our clan were being held as prisoners.
=====================================
Ar-726: It took six months. We trained without rest, using rudimentary weapons I prepared in the evenings. Every time the sun set, the likelihood of seeing our families grew ever smaller… Our first step was to go and scout our village.
=====================================
Ar-727: It had become a Nisshoku camp. It was guarded by at most ten men. Taking it would be risky, but we had waited too long. Anger was burning in our eyes, a molten metal flowing from furnaces in our skulls. We crept in by daylight at noon, when the Shadow essence would be at its weakest. Our first priority was to look for survivors.
=====================================
Ar-728: I still can’t find the words to describe what we found.
=====================================
Ar-730: After scouting the village, we noticed that the temple to Amaterasu was boarded up and locked. Its door destroyed, blocking any entry. Sora noticed this stood out from the rest of the village, so we decided to investigate.
=====================================
Ar-731: Squeezing through the cracks in the rubble, we were struck by a foul stench. Besides Amaterasu’s great statue, nothing was visible in the darkness. We could feel the fumes, the rot, permeating our skin.
=====================================
Ar-732: Eventually our eyes got used to the dark. In the shade were bodies. Strewn at random, or in piles, or shackled to the walls. The ones that had survived the Nisshoku attack were here, but they weren’t survivors. Family, friends, colleagues… all stuffed, rotting, into the very building where we paid respects to our goddess. In coming years we would discover that Nisshoku’s men had performed horrible experiments on the prisoners they took. “Research” into what made our command of the Light essence so powerful.
=====================================
Ar-733: The emptiness we felt in the mountains after the attack returned. Words, language, meaning left us. We felt everything and nothing. Ryo and Hikaru couldn’t stop watching the corpses. I didn’t dare. I could feel my mind fraying at the seams.
=====================================
Ar-734: Sitting with my eyes shut tight, suddenly there was an explosion. Sora and I turned to find Ryo and Hikaru gone. The temple’s buckled entrance was blown open.
=====================================
Ar-736: We left the temple immediately and caught a glimpse of Ryo and Hikaru’s figures leaping across the rooftops. The Nisshoku guards came running. Ryo and Hikaru… I’ve never seen men fight like that – before or since. They went berserk, leaping on Nisshoku soldiers like tigers, tearing out throats, faces, chests. Sora and I ran after them, trying to keep up, but they were inhumanly fast. The Nisshoku men didn’t stand a chance. They didn’t expect any sort of attack, let alone a full-frontal assault, in plain daylight, in an isolated village, from four kids.
=====================================
Ar-737: After a few minutes we realized they were all dead. All of the Nisshoku men. And that was it. The moment we all had been dreaming of for almost a year. The moment we took control and avenged our village.
=====================================
Ar-738: But it didn’t feel like we had imagined it. Not at all.
=====================================
Ar-741: We almost didn’t notice when Kibo appeared in the skies. His broad, black form was like the very embodiment of Amaterasu’s messenger, bringing us hope.
=====================================
Ar-742: Master Tsuyoshi had sent Kibo to check on the village. The sage had created a link between his soul and the bird, so we knew following Kibo on his long flight home would be a safe decision. We set off, without speaking a word between us, walking just behind his shadow.
=====================================
Ar-743: As we walked, our eyes opened. More and more, hour upon hour, day upon day. We realized a vast world was in front of us. We didn’t trust, or even speak to, anyone to begin with. But every new place and culture we encountered fascinated us. Weeks later, we understood our place in a bigger picture. In a larger conflict.
=====================================
Ar-745: The more we travelled, the more we saw, the more we learned… the more we realized how deep and broad the scars left by Nisshoku were. Across the entire continent. They said Nisshoku were born from an ancient guild of assassins. A sect with hundreds of followers. Their leader, whom they called the “Shadow Empress,” was considered a goddess. They said her power was extraordinary. Her objective was apparently nothing less than the destruction of all Light brotherhoods they could find… but they made no distinctions. Any non-Darkness guild would fall at their feet.
=====================================
Ar-746: On the road we met one broken family after another. Entire cultures that had met the same fate as our own. But we met people who wanted to fight back too. People that wanted to avenge their loved ones, people who wanted their lives back, people who wanted to live without fear. They had the will, but lacked the guidance. They needed a common leader.
=====================================
Ar-748: Eighteen months had passed since our journey began. Seeing the wreckage left in Nisshoku’s wake, we grew in strength and wisdom, and learned just how much damage Nisshoku had caused.
=====================================
Ar-749: Eventually, after following Kibo for months, he began descending rapidly, rushing to his final destination. As we reached where Kibo had landed, we were greeted by the bright smile of Master Tsuyoshi. Meeting him again almost felt like coming home.
=====================================
Ar-752: Master Tsuyoshi taught us the basics of manipulating Life essence. I had read legends about it, but still the countless uses Master Tsuyoshi revealed amazed me. He taught us how to control our inner peace. How to block the inner peace of others. How to heal any wound. There was little wonder why he was considered a sage.
=====================================
Ar-753: For a Light adept like me, using another essence was like trying to write with the wrong hand (I must say, however, that yours truly was the first to attune to it – and with ease). This new essence took the form of a green flame when summoned. It felt like spring water rippling through your soul. Peaceful… That is, until the Master taught us how to apply it in combat.
=====================================
Ar-754: Applied to combat, Life essence allows one to heal wounds at incredible speed. But it doesn’t end there. Certain techniques allow you to transfer part of your own soul to someone else, or vice versa, temporarily. You can empower yourself with another’s soul, and drain their own essence. But this technique is difficult to control. Breaking the body–soul balance like that… The potential consequences were terrifying.
=====================================
Ar-755: And just when we thought we had learned all we could, when we thought Master Tsuyoshi’s teaching was slowing down… he gave us one last piece of wisdom. “The technique I’m going to show you now was branded as forbidden long ago,” he said. “It is risky. Dangerous. It should only be used as a last resort. If all else fails... it could help you defeat the Shadow Empress.”
=====================================
Ar-757: Once we finished training with Master Tsuyoshi, we started recruiting. We already had allies from the various villages and cities we had passed through, and after reaching out to those we met, the word spread and others started to come to us. There were adepts from all the clans, of various essences and practices – even people who weren’t adepts. Not all of them were ready to fight, but most of them had potential.
=====================================
Ar-759: During our travels we had found huge veins of a rare mineral called Hikalcum, which can store and emit Light essence. If we could infuse our army’s weapons with Hikalcum, it would barely matter how inept a soldier was with Light essence… Our Light “charge” would empower them. I tested it, and it proved successful. I even infused our four weapons with the mineral as well. This simple action would make the difference in the war to come.
=====================================
Ar-760: After six months of preparation, our army was ready. With Ryo, Hikaru, Sora, and I as its leaders, our newly formed brotherhood was ready to put an end to Nisshoku’s reign. Kaiho was born.
=====================================
Ar-762: The last preparations have been made. We depart next week.
=====================================
Ar-763: I hardly can sleep. My heart is in my throat. This is the moment we all have been waiting for. At least recalling these memories, all that we have achieved, has calmed me a little. Looking back, the change within us gives me strength – from children living blissfully ignorant of how big the world was, to leaders of an army.
=====================================
Ar-764: The men are anxious. I can hear them pacing in their tents nearby. They are fed not by water or food, but by a passion for revenge. To destroy Nisshoku. Even Master Tsuyoshi is going to fight, despite his age. He has learned how to use Light essence almost as well as us native adepts.
=====================================
Ar-765: I wonder how I’ll feel once I see the high walls of Kyuryu, Nisshoku’s capital. I wonder how I will feel when the Shadow Empress shows herself to us… They say her power is such that she can kill dozens of men in the blink of an eye. But we won’t hesitate. We’ve come this far. Our Sun Goddess lights our path. We will win.
=====================================
Ar-767: It shouldn’t have ended like this.
=====================================
Ar-768: True victory was almost within reach. Just beyond our grasp. But even after Ryo… Even then, we couldn’t stretch that last inch.
=====================================
Ar-769: The rumors about the Shadow Empress were true. They didn’t exaggerate one bit. In the end we had to use the Forbidden Technique to trap her, and now we suffer the consequences. I can feel her in my chest. It gets worse if we are close together, so we have hardly seen each other since… I hope the talismans serve us well...
=====================================
Ar-770: Some say that we won. Indeed, perhaps we decimated Nisshoku’s forces. Perhaps we trapped their empress. But it didn’t feel like a victory. Not at all. This is only a temporary peace. She’ll do anything within her power to free herself. We have to avoid that at all costs. So we will guard this place. All the sacrifices we’ve made won’t be in vain.
=====================================
Ar-772: March 10, Year 15 of the Sixth Age
=====================================
Ar-773: This pain is becoming unbearable. Master Tsuyoshi once described what having a corrupted soul felt like, but I could never have imagined it would be this extreme... I wish he was still with us. He and Ryo.
=====================================
Ar-775: I contacted Hikaru and Sora. They will help me pass another part to another adept. It’s risky, but I can’t hold on anymore. If only I were stronger.

GoOfWa20-2: ﻿[We meet our hero Kratos in the forest. He looks sad, tired and old. His face is overgrown with a thick beard. Kratos stands by a high birch with an axe in his hands. He touches the birch with his palm print and cuts it down with a few powerful strokes. The strokes unwind the bandages on his hand. He looks at it for a while and then wraps them back up. A boy comes up to him with a branch in his hand.]
=====================================
GoOfWa20-1064: Kratos:Wait… Come back!
=====================================
GoOfWa20-1084: Oh look. The blue door that’s not a door… and a sand bowl. But how do you expect me to reach it?
=====================================
GoOfWa20-1212: Kratos:We found his Alchemist. A reward was promised.
=====================================
GoOfWa20-1752: You’re welcome!
=====================================
GoOfWa20-2314: Never in a God, but… a God believing himself mortal? I can only imagine… We’re almost there. Somebody just called the serpent.
=====================================
GoOfWa20-2679: Watch out father! Kráku lið! (Shitty crew!? Whew! He was big. But no match for us gods.
=====================================
GoOfWa20-2691: Atreus return the vessel to Kratos, but he does not take it back and offers Atreus to drink from it.
=====================================
GoOfWa20-3225: Mimir:Can’t be that. It’s not like you go through Vanaheim to reach the Midgard peak.
=====================================
GoOfWa20-3382: Mimir, why did you work for Odin if he’s so horrible?
=====================================
GoOfWa20-3588: Atreus:That was your father in Hel… Is this what it is to be a god? Is this what it is to be a god? Is this how it always ends? Sons killing their mothers… their fathers?
=====================================
GoofWaGhofSp-16: The Archimedean Screw was created to transfer water from low to high ground. The Atlanteans improved upon this technology by crafting screws out of rare nearly indestructible mineral that could withstand high temperatures. Placed these screws at key locations a inside the volcano to channel the pressure building within, in the hopes of preventing an eruption that could destroy Atlantis and mark the end of their great civilization.
=====================================
GoofWaGhofSp-31: Named after Hercules, the city of Heraklion is the capital of Crete and the main trading city of Atlantis.
=====================================
GoofWaGhofSp-53: The lifeless body of a slain Spartan lays on the ground, having given his life to protect the entrance to the city. The treacherous pass within the 7 mounts of Aroania is one of the few routes into Sparta. These mountains are also the proving grounds where young warriors are sent alone to face their deepest fears before being given the honor to join the ranks of the Great Spartan Army.
=====================================
GoofWaGhofSp-77: Ares was often called upon before the Spartans went into battle. Sacrifices were made in his name to solicit his blessing and the Spartans chose their prisoners of war for this purpose. Once Kratos took his place as the new God of War, Sparta's devotion turned towards the one they saw as their own, save for a few staunch supporters of Ares.
=====================================
GoofWaGhofSp-84: The shrine of Boreas, god of the North Wind. Known as the devouring one, he sweeps from the northern mountains chilling the air with his icy breath, Boreas carries a giant conch, an artifact that is said to channel the might of the North Wind.
=====================================
GoofWaGhofSp-92: The once beautiful daughter of king Midas, turned by his touch into a golden statue. Midas, the king of Macedonia, was granted a wish by Silenus the Satyr. But his wish soon became a curse. He slowly began to lose his sanity at the sight of everything in his world turning into gold by his mere touch.
=====================================
GoofWaGhofSp-103: The harbor of Atlantis, home to the greatest armada in the lands of Greece. It is renowned as a center for trade, knowledge and progress throughout the world of man.
=====================================
GoofWaGhofSp-109: Lord Poseidon, the God of the Seas, took dominion over the oceans when the Olympians ascended to power. The kingdom of Atlantis was erected in his honor by his followers and the many statues built in his image around the city were constructed as integral parts of the structure and mechanism of Atlantis itself.

GoofWaGhofSp-111: The power of the God of the Seas flow inside the kingdom of Atlantis and its channeled at nexus points spread throughout the city. When imbued with this power, the Effigies of Poseidon can focus this energy to activate the structures and mechanisms around Atlantis.
=====================================
GoofWaGhofSp-130: The domain of death lies outside the realm of Olympus and the world of mortals, it existed long before the rule of the Titans and the Olympians and remains one of the most feared places by both men and gods alike. Few have ever ventured here. None have left alive.

HoZeDa-1371: Theodor "Ted" Faro (born December 24, 2013) is an American entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder of Faro Automated Solutions (FAS), the largest corporation of all time. the world’s wealthiest individual, and the first-ever trillionaire. Born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he studied business for two years before dropping out in 2033 to start FAS. Though it struggled at first, the company broke through at the end of the troubled 2030s with its popular lines of personal servitors and bodyguard bots, then exploded when its famous line of green robots led the race to solve the climate crisis during the 2040s "Claw-back." At the end of that decade, FAS opened a military defense branch, dominating the world market for automated military platforms by 2053. The success of FAS has made Mr. Faro the world’s best-known businessman, one of its most sought- after speakers, and a major voice in politics, culture, and international affairs.
=====================================
HoZeDa-1373: Elisabet Sobeck (born March 11, 2020) is an American scientist, roboticist, and engineer, widely regarded as one of the greatest minds of the 21st century. Born and raised outside Carson City Nevada, she enrolled at Stanford University at age 13, earning a BS in Experimental Physics and Computer Science at age 16. She completed her Ph.D. in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Design at Carnegie-Mellon University in 2040 and joined Faro Automated Solutions as a Junior Scientist the same year, rising quickly to Chief Scientist at the age of 22. Over the next eight years, her green robot designs played a vital role in realizing the environmental cleanup and detoxification efforts of The Claw-back decade, propelling FAS to the forefront of its field. In 2048, she suddenly resigned from FAS, protesting the company’s pivot to automated military technologies. In 2049, she founded Miriam Technologies, a firm devoted to life-positive robotics and other technologies. Miriam has since become one of the world’s largest suppliers of green robots, winning numerous awards and accolades, including the 2053 Nobel Prize for Physics and the 2056 Rachel Carson Award for Environmental Progress.
=====================================
HoZeDa-1375: Faro Automated Solutions (FAS) is an American multinational corporate entity that produces robots for all walks of life, though its core business consists of military and defense contracts. As of 2063. FAS has ranked 1 among the Fortune 50 by gross revenue and profit for ten years in a row, a world record. Founded in 2033 by Theodor "Ted" Faro, an entrepreneur from Salt Lake City. Utah, the company developed several promising robot prototypes in its early years but failed to break into markets dominated by then - industry giants like General Synthetics and RECorp. This changed in 2038 with the debut of the @lfred line of levitating personal servitors, which generated exceptional sales, lifting the company onto the Fortune 50 for the first time. Profits tripled in the 2040s as the company’s environmental efforts, led by famed engineer Elisabet Sobeck, catapulted FAS to the head of that sector. In 2049, in the wake of successful green and climate cleanup efforts around the globe, worldwide approval ratings of FAS exceeded 90% and founder Ted Faro was hailed across media and social networks as "the man who saved the world." Yet it was the emergence of FAS as a military contractor in the late 2040s that cemented its status as the world’s wealthiest corporation, with a record market capitalization of over trillion. By 2055, FAS controlled 61% of the market share for automated military platforms, holding contracts with 353 nations, trans- governmental organizations, and corporate entities. Today, its holdings exceed the second largest corporation (FBMobilHal Global) by 321%.

HoZeDa-2097: Candidates must be allowed to ask questions and be given the necessary time to fully absorb the information they have received. It is important to be aware that candidates have just been exposed to triggers for severe mental and emotional trauma. Do not assume silence or outward calmness indicates acceptance. It is essential to stress that all other options for combating the Faro Plague and preserving the continuation of human life have been considered, and found unworkable. Communicate this fact calmly, but clearly and firmly. Familiarize yourself with data on the catastrophic environmental impact of nuclear engagements vs. the swarm (Addendum B1) and unfeasibility of maintaining life in orbital, lunar, or undersea structures (Addenda C1, C2, C3) so that you can counter candidates’ objections in depth. If a candidate asks for time alone to review supplementary information, allow this without hesitation. Be sure to inform security personnel so the candidate can be monitored for attempts at self-harm. Candidates should only be cleared to proceed to Presentation 2 if you believe their mental state is sufficiently stable. Note that real-time support will be available via your Focus.

Me-57: -for Witches and Witchcraft enthusiast
=====================================
Me-58: A Witches Coven would reach the height of its power only then all of they Sacred Flames were all right. Witches have been known to offer help to the questing adventurer, yet they are a reclusive people and have to be summoned by the aid of mystic Charms or Talismans. Let it be known that help from a Witch is rarely given freely, and the Witch will more often than not make a request of the adventurer before any such help is given. If seeking to summon a Witch, remember that they quite territorial. Any signs of previous Witch activity in an area is good indication that a Witch can be called upon.
=====================================
Me-180: During the dark time that was Gallowmere’s not too distant past it was King Peregrin who thwarted Zarok the Necromancer and his plan to enslave the land.
=====================================
Me-181: Zarok, once the King’s mage had fallen out of favour with the Ruler for conducting outlandish experiments on the bodies of the dead. It was said that deep within Peregrin Castle the dead were restless.
=====================================
Me-182: “The dead are to be honoured; not kept as the play things of alchemists!” declared King Peregrin as he banished Zarok from the Castle. All of Zarok’s living dead were routed out and destroyed. Zarok being an unforgiving soul went into hiding and vowed to wreak is revenge on the King.
=====================================
Me-184: Rumors of ill doing and dark deeds abounded through the land of Gallowmere. It was whispered that Zarok had employed the aid of Shadowy Demons to help build a vast castle. Under the cover of night, Zarok’s dark army spilled forth from their corrupt haven. The army marched south across the Silver Mountains and through the Silver Woods. Soon afterwards, even the Pumpkin lands belonged to Zarok. The folk of Gallows Town cried out for help, “Save us good King Peregrin!”.
=====================================
Me-185: Retaliation was swift and violent. King Peregrin’s forces led by brave Sir Fortesque drove Zarok’s army back from Gallows Town. There was much rejoicing, but the war was not yet over.
=====================================
Me-187: News that Zarok’s army had now taken the flood lands caused much concern. From this vantage point Zarok could march west to take the Enchanted Forest. This sacred place would prove a bitter defeat if it fell into the hands of the evil sorcerer.
=====================================
Me-188: It was Sir Dan Fortesque who once again led the King’s Militia to rid the demon host from the land. Yet the evil wizard was cunning and had prepared an ambush. The titanic battle ensued of which history has never since seen the like.
=====================================
Me-192: Zarok’s body was never found, though if it lies unmourned in an unmarked grave then no one in Gallowmere would shed a tear.
=====================================
Me-193: The Shadow Demons that had fallen under Zarok’s banner were unnatural creatures that did not belong in the world of mortal men. The King declared that they be banished, entombed under the pure earth of the Enchanted Earth.
=====================================
Me-194: Imprisoned within an impregnable box of the King’s design, the Demons were buried deep underground. Their Tomb was sealed with a magical device that has since come to be known as the Shadow Artefact.
=====================================
Me-196: In addition to being the strongest man who ever lived Stanyer Iron Hewer was unsurpassed in his skill as a blacksmith. He was equally happy pounding on his anvil at hoe as he was pounding on someone’s head in battle. It was said that his only fear was the end of the village smithy as the focus of manufacture in favour of more centralised units – as if!
=====================================
Me-197: Born a humble peasant to one of the nomadic tribes from the Eastlands, Bloodmonath Skull Cleaver gathered an army of horsemen and swept over half the civilized world, When he finally died(attempting a single handed attack on a garrison in the North while armed only with the pike on his helmet) he was the richest and most powerful peasant of his day.
=====================================
Me-198: Karl Sturnguard spent most of his formative years under siege at his family castle. With his impregnable magic shield Sturnguard’s motto was “the best form of attack is defence”. Sadly his shield couldn't protect him from poor eating habits and he died during a post battle feast while swallowing a large sausage he had failed to chew.
=====================================
Me-199: Truly the hero’s hero Woden the Mighty, was fearless single-minded, and uncompromising. Unbeaten in combat, he inspired raw fear in friends and enemies alike, not to mention in close family members and pets.
=====================================
Me-200: Trained from birth in all forms of combat, Imanzi Shongama was the warrior queen of a tribe of Amazons. The bold and the beautiful Shongama banished all males from her territory except the handful she kept on to mow the lawns of her people.
=====================================
Me-201: A full time mother and homemaker, Megwynne Stormbinder had to defend her settlement from barbarian riders while the menfolk were away on a hunting trip. She fought off repeated attacks armed only with pitchfork and a rolling pin and with one arm holding her baby. Legend has it that the Gods, impressed by her indomitable courage, intervened and added thunder bolts to her arsenal. She won the battle with a couple of bolts to spare on her husband when he finally returned.
=====================================
Me-203: Descended from the finest centaur bloodstock RavenHooves the Archer was the last prince of his people. A proud and haughty aristocrat he was an accomplished hunter, sportsman, duelist, playboy, raconteur, and three times Derby winner.
=====================================
Me-204: Captain of the Militia in the time of King Peregrin, Sir Daniel Fortesque found fame when he killed the renegade wizard Zarok. A career soldier raised in the royal household he was adored by the men under his command and renowned for his loyalty to Gallowmere. It was said that Fortesque was always destined for greatness, with his square jaw, steely gaze and thick shock of hair, as black as ravens’ wings, he looked every inch the hero.
=====================================
Me-206: The land of Gallowmere is a wondrous land of breath taking sights and adventure.
=====================================
Me-207: If it’s beauty you are looking for, be sure to check out the sights of the Enchanted Forest.
=====================================
Me-208: Scale the heights and see the nest of giant Dragon Birds. Seek out weird and wonderful plain life. Go “ooh” and “ahh” at the sight of baby Dragon Toads splashing about in the crystal clear pounds.
=====================================
Me-209: Why not take a walk through the Pumpkin valley!
=====================================
Me-210: Pumpkin is Gallowmere’s favorite dish, and about now the valley is just bulging under the weight of young podlings awaiting harvest.
=====================================
Me-212: If it’s mystery you’re looking for then the seasoned adventurer should travel to the ruins of King Peregrin’s castle.
=====================================
Me-213: Yes, this is the fortress from which the fabled King Peregrin once hailed! It is said that the King’s Crown was lost in the dungeons below the Castle and that the ghost of the regent himself now haunts those cold stone passage ways. Spooky!
=====================================
Me-214: Why not take to the swamps and seek out the mythical town of Mellowmede!
=====================================
Me-215: This place was once said to be a place of fantastical arcane alchemy, but an age has passed since it was consumed by murky swamps. Perhaps great treasure awaits any adventurer that can locate its watery resting place?
=====================================
Me-217: I must make haste for Zarok’s men will be here within the hour. I have taken the crucifix from the church – it is the key to a key.
=====================================
Me-218: I used the cross to make the attached cast, then I had it destroyed. It is my hope that this cast falls into the hands of a just and good hero.
=====================================

Midst these wars, two powerful warriors Hashirama and Madara, who were once close friends, found themselves on opposing sides. They rocked the earth, grit their teeth, and let their anger and sadness swirl together as they fought for their lives.
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-23: In the present, the curtain has risen on the Fourth Great Ninja War, and the furious battles raged on. Behind the scenes, Sasuke Uchiha reunited with his older brother Itachi and questioned himself about his own path. What are ninja? What is a village? What is a clan? Behind the lone Sasuke, old allies drew near…
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-54: After resurrecting Orochimaru, Sasuke enlisted his help and headed to the place where those who know all' wait Hidden Leaf Village, Sasuke's old home, and the place where he had spent time with his old friends. At an Uchiha clan shrine far off the beaten path, he and Orochimaru began a certain ceremony.
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-100: Hashirama and Madara... Their bonds had been deep ever since they were children. They chased the same dreams and searched for ways to realize them. They created a village in order to rip down the walls between their clans. As the two heroes of Hidden Leaf Village, their legacies should have both been passed down to future generations. However…
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-143: After meeting the Hokage and finding his 'answer' Sasuke turned his eyes to the battlefield. Far off, a furious battle capable of shaking the entire planet was unfolding. It was time for Sasuke to head to war.

In order to stop Tobi's Project Tsuki no Me, Naruto continues to fight alongside his allies.
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-232: The bloody battles of the Third Great Ninja War got worse and worse as time went on. They were cruel days, in which even young boys and girls were drawn in to battle. Kakashi Hatake belonged to a small team led by Naruto's father, Minato, and was sent to the battlefield along with Obito and Rin. Alter becoming a Jonin, he received his first mission, and a strong sense of duty began to bum in young Kakashi's heart…
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-274: Midst the uneasiness following Kakashi and Obito's split, Team Minato broke Into two groups and hurried to complete their mission. In a deep, dark forest, Kakashi and his allies raced through the trees, behind which ninjas of the Hidden Stone Village lurked.. Without any Inclination of the cruel tate that awaited them, they kept moving straight ahead…
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-369: In the darkness he awoke... Obito Uchiha. He should have been dead, but a ghost had saved him and given him a new path to walk down. Would this path lead him back to his allies... or somewhere completely different?
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-448: Ninja of the Mist:Was that… Wood Style?! Only the first Hokage of the Hidden Leaf can use that jutsu, right?
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-459: After assuming Madara Uchiha's name, Obito began walking in the darkness, in order to make his dreams come true. His darkness swallowed up the Hidden Leaf Village, leading him to sacrifice his soul in order to capture the Nine Tails and raise a blade against his old Sense... as the Hidden Leaf Village burned, accompanied by a symphony of bloodcurdling screams and the roars of the Nine Tails…
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-482: Before Obito and his darkness, despite his misgivings, Kakashi hardened his resolve and continued to fight. As Madara Uchiha, the source of it all arrived on the battlefield, the battle proceeded to its next stage, and the roars of the Gedo Statue, the husk of the Ten Tails, finally ceased. Moonlight poured down on the silent battlefield until something broke through the tense air…
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-527: The Ten Tails... the crux of Project Tsuki no Me, and the ultimate threat which possesses the power of every Tailed Beast, had been revived on the battlefield.

NaUlNiSt4-556: Allied Shinobi Forces Technique!!!
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-615: As Madara and Obito began their violent assault, the Ten Tails roared. The earth quaked and the ground split. Clad in expressions filled with pain and suffering, the ninja who survived the Cataclysm gradually began to lose all means of resistance. The Allied Ninja Forces were on the brink of defeat, and Madara and Obito were only growing stronger. But Naruto's eyes still burned, and a rising premonition even made him smile a bit.
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-673: As the battle of Madara and Obito vs. the Allied Ninja Forces took a new turn, Kakashi and Obito moved into an alternate dimension and began matching blades. Their wills were once allied, but would never join hands ever again. In order to stop his best friend, who had thrown the world into chaos, Kakashi prepared himself to defeat Obito once and for all.
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-716: At long last, a Ten Tails Jinchuriki who had absorbed the power of the Ten Tails appeared in the ninja world. Surpassing his human husk, Obito had acquired the power of the Sage of the Six Paths himself, and was finally capable of making his dreams come true. Regardless of the impending threat, Naruto and Sasuke kept their eyes focused straight ahead.
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-746: As the fight between Naruto's group and Obito became more and more intense, Hashirama and Madara fought each other one-on-one. Normally, there should have been no way for them to ever get a rematch with each other, but somehow they had been both brought back to the material world to fight once more, which filled Madara with ecstasy. Meanwhile, Hashirama suffered alone, unable to find the reason why Madara decided to walk down a different path...
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-765: Naruto Uzumaki chased his dream of becoming Hokage, and is still working hard to move forward and achieve that goal. On the other side. Obito Uchiha gave up on his dream of becoming Hokage, and had pulled the ninja world into darkness. These two, who once held the same dream, were now in the process of finishing their violent battle. One embraced his dreams, while the other ran from them. Who will be the one to achieve victory?
=====================================

Cheers sounded through the battlefield, the sealed Tailed Beasts were released. and it felt like victory had arrived. However… Madara Uchiha, the true puppet master, who had controlled even Obito, continued to show an invincible smile. Yes.. The battle was still tar from over.
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-899: Do not compare me to some brat who took years to get his pet back. This will take seconds. Watch. Limbo - Border Jail!!
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-906: Now all the Tailed Beasts are together. Next comes...
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-936: Without Kurama, Naruto stood helpless in the face of Madara's overwhelming power. His dreams, allies, bonds connections, and everything else floated up and began to disappear... And then...
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-949: Their connections should have been broken. But despite how much time had passed, their bond was still there. Kakashi Hatake and Obito Uchiha. The old allies had faced each other and become best friends once more... Despite standing before Madara Uchiha, who now possessed the power of the Sage of the Six Paths, there wasn't the faintest glimmer of fear in their hearts.
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-1018: After Obito was sent to Naruto, the only ones left on the ground were covered in wounds. Then, as they prepared themselves for death, a hot, blazing ninja alighted. It was Might Guy. As a Hidden Leaf Village Jonin, he possessed a powerful will that would naught quell to any foe. In order to take on the In Madara, Gay shed his own humanity and risked his life... roaring into the future!
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-1072: Orochimaru and the members of the Taka could immediately feel Sasuke's death. Paralyzed by fear, they hurried to him, only to be stopped by something mysterious. As the ninja began to panic, Orochimaru kept his cool and smiled. Next to him stood his old teacher, the Third Hokage, Hiruzen.
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-1097: The one who saved Sasuke was Kabuto, who had been trapped in the infinite genjutsu 'Izanami' by Sasuke's older brother, Itachi. How did he break out of the jutsu, and why had he come to the battlefield? Just what had Itachi caused to happen?
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-1108: After going through the loop over and over, my mind started to deteriorate... I was unable to come to a conclusion, and lost all confidence...

=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-1359: Sasuke:Hmph!
=====================================
NaUlNiSt4-1395: They had both led each other to growth. They had both forced each other to walk down separate paths. They had walked together, created joy, created sadness, created panic, and created bonds. But the dreams they dreamed of began to change, and they split apart into a ninja who focused on his allies and a ninja who focused on revolution. Which path would history choose? Now, everything would be decided. This would be the final battle between Naruto and Sasuke!
=====================================

NiGa-103: "Tonight is the night of rebirth which comes only once every 700 years.
=====================================
NiGa-119: "...but even you cannot defeat "the masked devil"
=====================================
NiGa-129: “I’ve got to think clearly. Father’s eyes… they show he is controlled like a puppet. If I break the control…
=====================================
NiGa-130: “But What is controlling him? That’s it!”
=====================================
NiGa-150: “While we've still got time. Before the “black moon” shines.”
=====================================
NiGa-157: “Take that woman and escape.”
=====================================
NiGa-160: “Ryu, good luck...”
=====================================
NiGa-162: “Father!!!”
=====================================
NiGa-180: “the darkness is finally over.”
=====================================
NiGaIIThDaSwofCh-2: ﻿[At the top of the old castle stands a man in a purple cloak. Ninja approaches him.]
=====================================
NiGaIIThDaSwofCh-12: [text on screen) “One year after the fateful battle with JAQUIO... A new adventure begins for RYU HAYABUSA, the Ninja of the Dragon Sword.”
=====================================
NiGaIIThDaSwofCh-83: Back off, you bothersome swine. I'll deal with you later.
=====================================
NiGaIIThDaSwofCh-156: Man:... Hm...
=====================================
NiGaSi2-3: The ruthless, bloodthirsty vampire-fiends, versus the destroyers of evil since times of old, the Dragon Lineage. A millennium of war between the two now draws towards an inevitable final battle.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-6: Lord of the vampires, a fiend of the highest level. Possesses superhuman hearing. Dwells in internal darkness.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-9: Heir to the dragon lineage and master of Hayabusa ninja clan.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-17: Young ninja of Hayabusa clan. An expert in his art. He is a "master ninja"
=====================================
NiGaSi2-19: A legendary blade carved from the dragon god's fang. Inherited by the Hayabusa ninja clan. Handed down to Ryu by Joe Hayabusa.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-27: A priceless treasure of the Dragon Lineage. Its fearsome power is entrusted to the dragon shrine-maiden.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-29: In time. It will come to be called "The Vampire War"
=====================================
NiGaSi2-33: The ancestral home of the dragon lineage, hidden in the shadows of mount Fuji. Home of the Hayabusa clan.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-35: The young sister of the shrine-maiden Kureha, who sacrificed her life in the dark dragon blade incident. The latest dragon shrine-maiden, she is a genius with the sword.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-43: A clan of evil ninja that has plagued the Hayabusa time and time again. Craving nothing but power, their twisted hunger has twisted theirs bodies as well.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-46: “Special agent Sonia appears at the door of the tiny shop run by master swordsmith Muramasa amidst the skyscrapers of Tokyo. She inquires after the ninja Ryu Hayabusa, his whereabouts a mystery. She brings news of a terrible danger facing the world, bearing a message that must reach Hayabusa at any cost. As night falls, the evil Black Spider Ninja Clan emerges from the shadows to infest the streets of this unsuspecting city.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-63: Why, I ask you, why?
=====================================
NiGaSi2-64: Why am I incapable of finishing off my enemies?
=====================================
NiGaSi2-65: The order apprentices lop off heads left and right.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-66: When an opponent lies before me, blood spurting from mortal wounds, begging for the mercy of my blade.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-67: I stand there like a practice dummy. I can't bring myself to use the Obliteration Technique.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-68: Now that I think of it, my life has been full of tragedy.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-71: My master tells me that the technique of Shadowless Footsteps is a basic ninja maneuver.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-73: In that case I must be lacking in ninja spirit, because I'm completely incapable of performing this simple technique.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-74: I slide down the wall, or I slam my forehead against its surface.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-75: If it weren't for my metal headpiece, I'd have cracked my skull open by now.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-76: When my comrades reach a valley, I slow them down.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-77: When up against a castle wall, they must carry me over.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-78: They say that in life, one must learn to rise above obstacles.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-79: I'd rather knock all these walls down.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-80: I never want to see another wall as long as I live.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-91: “The shadow of the Black Spider Clan reaches Hayabusa Village. They hunt for the Demon Statue, the key to resurrecting the Archfiend. Only Joe Hayabusa, his body still mending from his last battle, stands between them. Genshin, leader of the Black Spider Ninja Clan, faces his longtime rival in a fateful duel. As the Castle of the Dragon burns, the otherworldly Elizabet smiles coldly. The seal binding the Demon Statue is broken.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-101: The Flying Swallow?
=====================================
NiGaSi2-102: That's exactly the sort of thing I need!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-103: Sharp as a knife!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-104: Explosive power that makes your head spin!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-109: I'm incompetent.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-110: I'm a failure.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-111: My master taught me the secret technique of Reverse Wind, yet I am unworthy of his tutelage.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-112: I understand that I must first adopt a blocking stance, but then how am I to make my feet step so quickly in another direction?
=====================================
NiGaSi2-113: I always end up face-down, my legs entangled, my chest aching after a belly flop into the hard ground.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-114: There must be something else, something greater than Reverse Wind that I am destined to master.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-115: After all, I am meant for artistic pursuits - perhaps even sorcery.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-116: I must follow my destiny.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-119: I'm not good at the technique of Ultimate Guidance.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-120: I'm probably the worst in the clan.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-121: When i see Essence near me, I grab the hilt of my sword, close my eyes, and focus my Ki energy, but the Essence doesn't burge.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-122: Instead, I end up getting kicked in the face.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-123: In the thick of battle, I've never once pulled off a true Ultimate Technique.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-124: Sure, I've made it to the first level of charge.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-125: But I've never even seen the second or third levels.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-126: Master of Ultimate Guidance absorb the Essence created from their first Ultimate Technique.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-127: It's amazing how they create a wave of attack energy that repeats again and again, growing stronger every time.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-128: I, on the other hand, am only a master of getting kicked in the face.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-131: I am incapable of performing the Counter Attack.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-132: I understand that it's hidden power, unleashed when the enemy least expect it, makes the Counter Attack one of most valuable techniques there is.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-133: I react too quickly; I lack the patients to wait for my enemy to strike.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-135: Yet, the more I concentrate on timing, the more I fall victim to the bite of my enemy's attack.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-136: Skilled ninja counter opponents as easily as they breathe in and out.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-137: They react on reflex, moving not by thought but by instinct.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-138: My master even tells the young apprentice ninja, "Begin with something easy, like the Counter Attack."
=====================================
NiGaSi2-139: I must persevere.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-142: If I were a master of the Ultimate Technique, I would easily defeat that pest, the Dragon Ninja. If only it were so easy.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-143: I cannot perform the Ultimate Technique. I am numb to the waves of energy that surge in the wind.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-144: I don't even know where to begin.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-145: All I can do is look from afar as Master Genshin unleashes an explosive flurry of attack.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-146: He pauses, even in the midst of intense combat, and focused all of his energy into his weapon.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-147: But I, I am just a coward, to frightened to let my guard down for an instant.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-148: First I must find courage.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-149: If my destiny lies in the pit of the Underworld, so be it.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-157: “The graceful Alexei, one of the Four Greater Fiend appears in the skies over New York raining lighting upon the streets of the proud city.Ryu Hayabusa arrives in Manhattan in search of Elizabet, who escaped from Hayabusa Village with the Demon Statue.The Fiends have already begun transforming New York into a Fiend Realm.Ryu’s battle begins as the thunder and laughter of the Greater Fiend echo throughout the city.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-160: Countless millenia ago, long before the existence of other powerful Fiends, four great beings rose of power.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-161: Known as the King and Queen of the Fiends, together they split the Underworld into four sections, each ruling over their own domain.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-162: One, the ruler of Flame.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-163: The third, the ruler of Lighting.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-164: The last, the ruler of Blood.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-166: “Alexei has transformed the Statue of Liberty into his own twisted base of operations. It is the source of the supernatural forces that twine through the city streets. As if laughing at the concept of "liberty", peals of thunder roar, harbingers of the threat facing civilization. The Statue must be reclaimed or humanity will suffer. After making his way to Liberty Island, Ryu steely gaze now falls upon the Greater Fiend Alexei.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-175: Eventually, the tension between the four Fiend Rulers evolved into fierce battle.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-176: The world was plunged into chaos, as though Hell had erupted upon Earth.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-177: This infernal conflict drew the attention of one of the Archfiends known as Vazdah.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-178: Slowly, he arose from hes deep slumber to observe the commotion.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-179: Lord Vazdah′s gaze alighted upon a man, a lone human who plummeted into the deep abyss of the Archfiend′s stare.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-184: “Genshin descends upon Hayabusa Village once again, his Black Spider Clan crushing its brave young ninja.Faced with the devastation of her village, Momiji, the Dragon Shrine-maiden, resolves to free a young boy the enemy has taken prisoner.High above the unearthly glow of Sky City Tokyo, the shrine-maiden confronts a horde of evil ninja alone.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-197: “Elizabet′s whereabouts remain unknown, but her twisted plans continue to unfold as she unleashed the fearsome power of the Demon Statue. Wherever she goes, its power awakens one of Greater Fiends from his long slumber. The roar of Greater Fiend Volf, Ruler of Storms, echoes throughout a beautiful city of canals, transforming a Gothic castle into an evil fortress.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-201: “The canals running through this city lead to a giant castle, a once-beautiful architectural legacy now transformed into the lair of the Greater Fiend Volf. Volf's iron fist reigns over an army of werewolves. He is a Berserker, as bloodthirsty as a beast, end never-ending hunger for has led him to prepare a fitting arena for a duel to the death with world's most powerful ninja.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-203: I go forth with resolve, knowing that death surely awaits me.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-204: My fate shall be no different than that of the brave souls who lies at rest beneath the plains at the foot of Mt. Fuji; countless swords plunged in the ground to serve as gravestones at this, the graveyard of the Black Spider.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-205: I fight not for justice, nor for evil.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-206: I find it hard to believe that a man as powerful as Master Genshin would allow himself to be treated as a pawn by the Fiends.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-207: While it is true that our clan is distantly related to the Fiend bloodline.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-208: I cannot help but wonder if it is proper for us to assist them like this. I am as close to an apprentice of Master Genshin as anyone in our clan, and the more I learn of him, the more he puzzles me.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-209: Koshimaru may here the "Inner Eye", but the Master Genshin that I know is not afraid of anything.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-210: He is confident in his vast power.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-211: I found Hachijuro collapsed on the ground after suffering a grievous injury.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-212: I forcibly fed them the last of my Herb of Spiritual Life.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-213: Hope that he might survive, just as I know that he may not.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-214: Just as I know that I may soon suffer the same fate.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-215: What poor fortune.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-216: Attacked from behind by a Lesser Fiend.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-217: Thought they lack intelligence, they make up for it with their irrepressible ferocity. It appears to be instinct for them to attack humans.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-218: This is Fiend territory.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-219: I knew that something like this could happen at any time.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-220: It pains me to know that I will leave this world without even laying a finger on the Dragon Ninja.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-221: I am beginning to lose all strength in my hand.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-225: “The tranquility restored by Ryu's efforts is shattered by the reappearance of the Archfiend of the underworld. A beautiful demon-hunter descends amidst the skyscrapers, stalking the foul creatures that now infest the city. Fighting her way through the endless hordes, she attempts to restore place and order once again.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-236: “The fanged fortress of the wolf-beast toppled, Ryu and Sonia leave his twisted arena behind, taking to the skies in search of Elizabet. Ever northward, she is carried on wings of darkness, borne through the skies by the flying fortress Daedalus. She must be stopped, but the army of Genshin, sworn enemy of the Hayabusa clan, stands between Ryu and his quarry.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-278: I've heard that Master Genshin will take the lead in today's attack.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-279: My resolve is thus strengthened.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-280: It is time for the hated Dragon Ninja to pay for the humiliation he has caused us.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-281: Who is this Ryu Hayabusa?
=====================================
NiGaSi2-282: His father may have been strong enough in this day, but to think that such a stripling could be a Dragon Ninja is simply laughable!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-283: The fearsome Rasetsu and the powerful Gyuki of the Dark Sect have both been slain.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-284: If he defeated those monsters, then that young Ryu, evil as he is, must be worthy of the title of Dragon Ninja.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-285: The Dark Sect do the bidding of the Black Spider Clan, cloaked in shadow.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-286: Could it be that they aren't as fearsome as they look?
=====================================
NiGaSi2-287: No, I doubt that; they are born and bred berserkers.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-288: Apparently, the Tactical Ninja Teams that were deployed to the Aqua Capital have all been executed.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-289: I have received word that Koshimaru has perished.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-290: I find it hard to believe that he, possessor of the “Inner Eye”, could fall so easily.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-291: Although he was a man of logic, it seems now that his talk of the Inner Eye was just a stack of unproven theories.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-292: I, Yogenta, shall show my comrades what it is to be a true ninja of the Black Spider Ninja Clan.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-293: I have failed you, my brethren.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-294: Goodbye.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-295: May the Black Spider Ninja Clan flourish for eternity!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-338: I can't help but laugh at myself, writing in this stupid little notebook.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-339: Look, I haven't even updated this thing.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-340: I don't know what his deal is, but there's definitely more to him than meets the eye.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-341: He gets this smile, like he's been to Hell and back and sent a postcard while he was there.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-342: Man, this Daedalus sure is some piece of work.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-343: I mean, I know that the Black Spider Ninja Clan has its act together, but still, finding a heavy weapons factory to build this big-ass thing must have been tough.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-344: They say they used the profits from the previous Master's smuggling operations.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-345: I found Koshimaru's notebook.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-346: I know. I know. I'm not supposed to read it, but I did anyway.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-347: I mean, he even mentions me by name, can you believe it?
=====================================
NiGaSi2-348: Who is he, my third-grade teacher?!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-349: Well screw you, Mr. I-know-everything-'cause-I've-got-the-Inner-Eye Koshimaru!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-350: “No, sir, I don't read it, not a single page!”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-351: Hah!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-352: It sounds like Master Genshin has some history with that big, bad Dragon Ninja and his family.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-353: Apparently, some guy named Murai killed Master Genshin's little brother.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-354: Hey, look, I'm writing in my diary!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-356: The youth of today know nothing of the true ninja way.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-357: It is truly a deplorable state of affairs.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-358: As my comrades have seen fit to bestow upon me the title “Koshimaru of the Inner Eye”, I have vowed to uphold the way of the warrior and serve as a bastion of those who wish to learn the true Path of the Ninja.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-360: They believe themselves skilled because they can perform a few tricks.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-361: I see no path for this young ones that leads to growth and maturation.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-362: I shall keep these writings in the hope that day I may leave behind a scroll of wisdom for future generations.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-363: The youth are too quick to embrace the path of evil.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-365: It is precisely because the youth do not know true brutality that they are able to think that the path of evil is somehow fashionable.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-366: Those who appear evil do so because they truly understand the horrors that this world has to offer.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-367: On the name of our Black Spider Clan, I pray that our youth do not believe that the way of darkness is the easier path.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-368: If you possessed an Inner Eye like I do, you too would see the truth as though it were lying in the palm of your hand.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-369: Master Genshin is human, just lake the rest of us.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-370: He has a soul, and thus, he experiences fear.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-371: You must understand that, to achieve mighty goals, it is sometimes necessary to sell one's soul.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-372: Clearly, this is what Master Genshin is doing.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-384: “A young ninja glides into the city of water, utterly silent amid its ever-flickering lights, cunningly evading the traps laid for her. She is a <i>“ku-no-ichi”, a female ninja, dedicated to recovering a treasure of the Dragon Lineage from the fiends who stole it. Bathed in the moonlight, a deadly beauty races towards her final battle.”</i>
=====================================
NiGaSi2-394: “Elizabet's trail leads to an ominous realm in South America. This unholy land conceals the final component to resurrecting the Archfiend. Ryu Hayabusa penetrates its dark mangroves that teem with the heavy-armed forces of the Black Spider Ninja Clan on a path to the Lair of the Archfiend. Ryu journeys through a jungle far from civilization, a mysterious place where the secrets of the ancients dwell.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-396: “A great waterfall parts before Elizabet as if in fear of the Demon Statue held high above her head in a rain of blood. Behind it lies the gaping entrance to a massive cavern. The stench of blood reeks from its sculpted interior. Upon this altar, Infernal Priest Dagra Dai will breathe life into the Demon Statue once again. Ryu Hayabusa closes in on his quarry.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-398: I train intensively every day while I wait to be sent to the front lines.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-399: I'm never chosen for the really important missions.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-400: I've lost weight lately.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-401: I wonder if this has anything to do with my recent stomachaches?
=====================================
NiGaSi2-402: Regardless, now that I'm lighter, I can run faster, and I think I can even jump better!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-403: I've received orders for a special covert mission.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-404: Our clan's current strategy will take us all over the world.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-405: My duty is to scout out ahead, get the lay of the land at each of our destinations, and prepare for the arrival of the others.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-406: This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for me.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-407: Of course, I'm not the only one assigned to such an important mission – others will join me.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-408: Still, this is a great opportunity, and I have to make the most of it.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-409: These speedy legs of mine are going to carry me around the world!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-410: We're entering Fiend territory.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-411: Fiend infestation have sprung up throughout the world, and a group of them await us where we're headed.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-412: They say that they're allies – still, they are Fiends.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-413: Plenty of those beasts will feast on anything that moves.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-414: Not that I don't understand that.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-415: In the frenzy of combat, members of the Dark Sect of our clan lose their minds too.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-416: Those damn Fiends, they're eating the dead.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-417: They suck out all the fluids, then rip off the skin and tear at the flesh.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-418: Those of us who die during our travels are reduced to bare skeletons within hours.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-419: I pray that I don't suffer the same fate.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-420: I've been hacking through the thick jungle for days now, and it looks like I've contracted malaria.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-421: I'm out of supplies, and I lack the energy to go find more.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-422: I've fought off ever-increasing swarms of Fiends as I head to my final destination, the legendary pyramid of Necromantale.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-423: Just a little further to go, but I'm to tired to take another step.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-433: Worship of the Archfiends.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-434: Bless the holy Vigoor, he who hath wrought us as his progeny.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-435: Praise be to his successor, the Archfiend Vazdah, who stands above us as Lord of our order.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-436: His arms have been borne from the right arm of Vigoor, his legs have been borne from the left leg of Vigoor, his bones formed from holy Vigoor's flesh.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-437: Bless Vazdah's brain, sprung fourth from the mind of Vigoor himself.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-438: Hear the beating of the heart the echoes throughout the Underworld.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-439: Under the terrible grace of the Archfiends, we shall find true happiness.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-440: To those who live, but feel not yet alive, gather yourselves in the holy Lair of the Archfiend, sculpted by the Supreme Fiend Gogohn.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-441: Pray for the return of the holy land of Vigoor, once ruled by Gogohn, who roamed the Earth.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-442: Make your way to the heights of the burning mountain in the land where the sun rises.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-443: In this shrine, final resting place of Gogohn, bring forth the sacrifice bodies of innocent.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-444: Gather them at the feet of the beautiful Queen of Blood.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-445: We return the gospel of the Archfiend here, to the Necromantale, where it belongs.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-446: Archfiend Vazdah, rise up from your deep slumber.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-447: Gogohn's princess, the shrine maiden of blood, guides us.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-448: We stand gathered here in sacred Necromantale, ready to shed the blood of innocents.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-449: Though millennia may come and go, our prayers shall never cease.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-463: “Ryu returns to Hayabusa Village, resting in the shadow of sacred Mount Fuji. It is his final stop before heading to unholy ground, to the source of the supernatural forces threatening the world. Dragon Sword in hand, Ryu's body courses with unfathomable power. Atop the mountain from which this evil pours forth, Genshin awaits, intent on claiming the life of the last of the Dragon Lineage. The inevitable confrontation between Ryu and Genshin approaches.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-474: Above the Earth Dragons' paths that flow through the lands of Fuji, there lies a mountain that erupts with spirit.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-475: In the night, a faint white crown of light rests upon its peak.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-476: Lord Nobunaga, he who challenged the havens for control of the land, ordered that a stronghold be constructed at the height of the hollowed mountain.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-477: Lord Nobunaga, he who decimated the Ninja province of Iga, now sought the support of a select group of Ninja.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-478: In these times of civil war, even the most powerful feared the creatures that dwelt in the deep forests of Fuji.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-479: Lord Nobunaga knew of a superior clan, a group of warriors who had fought back the demons for generations.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-480: Know as the Hayabusa Ninja Clan, these descendants of the Dragon Lineage had long lived in these woods, slaying the evil spirits that dared to show themselves in the sacred lands of Fuji.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-482: The leader of the Hayabusa Clan, Shunden, shook hands with Lord Nobunaga and promised its construction.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-483: The castle was built, a strong face to stare down the evil menace.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-484: Thus did history record this event shortly before the indecent at Honno-ji that cost Lord Nobunaga his life.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-486: Master Genshin is quite different from our previous master, rest his soul.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-487: That old man had us ninja search the world for dragon bones to heal his aging body, and then he sold all of the leftovers for a hefty sum.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-488: But my heart pains for my brethren, god souls like Gen and Dai, who were sent to their deaths in Vigoor on such a fool's errand.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-489: Master Genshin is the true Overlord of our Black Spider Clan.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-490: I would gladly give me life for him – he need only say the word.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-491: Now that I think of it, that Obaba was quite the scary old hag when she was still alive.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-492: The hairs on the black of my neck used to stand up when I saw her cast her infernal sorcery.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-493: She only got away with what she did because she was in the right place at the right time.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-494: If Master Genshin had been there, she would have surely been kept in her place.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-495: Damn you, infernal beasts!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-496: These Fiends lunge at anything, devouring both friend and foe alike.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-497: Stupid creatures!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-498: I cannot believe I should be destined to die this way.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-499: I am badly injured.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-500: My consciousness grows faint.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-501: I must keep writing.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-502: Blood won't stop.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-503: I awoke to find myself still in the land of the living.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-504: What a disgrace I am.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-505: I have been told that Inukoma perished.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-506: I am only wish that I could have killed that cursed Dragon Ninja.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-507: Farewell.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-512: I seem to have misplaced the notebook I was using to write down my thoughts.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-513: How deeply depressing.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-514: He must learn that a true Ninja faces his fate with detachment and cold silence.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-515: Yogenta, if you let your bloodlust get to your head, even a skilled combatant like yourself will not last long in the blood-soaked world in which we live.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-516: Inukoma has died.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-517: He never learned that compassion is for the weak.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-518: If he had kept this Herb of Spiritual Life instead of giving it to Hachijuro, he would still be with us today.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-519: I must stay wary of the females.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-520: Perseverance, patience.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-521: Rest assured, it will be I who take the glory for defeating our sworn enemy.
=====================================
NiGaSi2-522: My Inner Eye has shown me exactly what I must do to destroy you!
=====================================
NiGaSi2-531: “Deep within Mount Fuji lies a hellish, tainted world, where the demented Infernal Priest Dagra Dai invokes dark ceremonies and incantations to resurrect the Archfiend. Every heartbeat of the fetal overlord rumbles like an omen of death foe the human race. Ryu enters the Underworld, there no human has ever set foot before. He does not yet realize that he is in the land of the dead, home to those who have shuffled of this mortal coil.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-543: “It is said that those who walk the frozen abyss of the Underworld are doomed, forbidden to ever again see the light of the living. In pursuit of the Archfiend, Ryu counters a beautiful prisoner – or is it merely a phantasm created by the Fiends? Evil claws reach for the Sonia; she has followed Ryu here. To return to the world of the living, Ryu must break through the barrier between illusion and reality.”
=====================================
NiGaSi2-552: “To save Sonia, Ryu fought his way through a sea of blood filled with vengeful spirits, reanimated by the evil of the Underworld. Now he confronts the Queen of the Greater Fiends in a final battle to the death. Dagra Dai's evil incantations are complete; the resurrection of the Archfiend is at hand. The Dragon Ninja walks the blade separating life and death.”
=====================================
NiGaSi-2: “In the mountains of Autumn, there is one who walks the path of the Ninja...”
=====================================
NiGaSi-24: "The sacred underground paths of the Dragons record all that occurs In the world of men. We have not forgotten those who live on the surface of the Earth...”
=====================================
NiGaSi-37: "The village is burning. Before long, Ryu hears the screams of his brethren..."
=====================================
NiGaSi-39: If you wish to find the Dark Dragon, you must simply start killing. It is said that the Dark Dragon's power grows as chaos and destruction grow in this world. There is no need for you to spare the subjects of the Vigoor Empire. You go there for revenge, do you not? The Dark Dragon revels in killing and destruction, if you provide these things, it is certain to call out to you. That is your destiny as a Dragon Ninja. Be aware of this as you enact your revenge!
=====================================
NiGaSi-52: Contains the Counter Attack techniques "Gleaming Cross" and Fiend's Bane Kick" which allows Ryu to counter enemy attacks immediately after blocking them.
=====================================
NiGaSi-53: Contains the technique "Guillotine Throw", in which Ryu grabs the enemy's neck while jumping and uses his momentum to toss the enemy for high damage.
=====================================
NiGaSi-54: Contains the technique "Izuna Drop", an air attack in which Ryu grabs his enemy in mid-air and slams them down on the ground for massive damage.
=====================================
NiGaSi-58: "This is regarding the incident on February 22nd in which all of the locks were deactivated. The source of the problem was found to be a malfunction of the primary power supply unit in the aft cabin. Voltage irregularities by the aging of the unit caused the failsafes to kick in, activating emergency power. In this type of situation, all locks aboard ship are de-activated as a safety measure. I recommend that we upgrade our electrical system as soon as possible."
=====================================
NiGaSi-59: The door is locked and won’t budge. There is a card slot next to the door. An ID Card of some sort must be necessary.
=====================================
NiGaSi-60: “Ryu has escaped from the crash of the Airship. Spread out before him is the city of Tairon, capital of the Vigoor Empire...”
=====================================
NiGaSi-63: A group of Ninjas dressed in black garb act with wicked intent in Tairon. They are members of the Black Spider Clan, and they act behind the scenes to hinder our progress. Do not let them leave Tairon alive.
=====================================
NiGaSi-65: ...ever since, these monsters have come to be known as Fiends. The majority of them are mutations of human beings, existing in a condition of living without a soul due to their of corruption by evil...
=====================================
NiGaSi-67: ...however the extraordinary power of the Fiends is incomparable to that of humans; in fact the highest level of Fiends exists in a state that can only be described as having transcended physical boundaries of form. Looking back through the pages of history, it is quite probable that many of the most powerful members of the Vigoorian ruling class in fact belonged to this classification. It is not surprising, then, that the Fiends have been seen as gods...
=====================================
NiGaSi-69: ...it is said that sometimes Fiends may rise up from dead bodies; in fact there Monks of the Vigoor Order during Middle Ages who labored for years to recreate this phenomenon...
=====================================
NiGaSi-71: ...the vast majority of records dealing with the Fiends date from the Middle Ages or earlier. During recent times the Fiends have greatly decreased in numbers; so much so that for member of the general Vigoorian public to come into contact with a Fiend has become an extremely rare occurrence...
=====================================
NiGaSi-83: “Searching for the whereabouts of her twin sister, Rachel the Fiend Hunter heads alone to the Dworku Monastery. She senses the presence of Fiends lurking In the shadows...”
=====================================
NiGaSi-91: ...the Vigoor Emperor is the figurehead of the commoners, and his absolute authority as the Holy leader of our Vigoorian Order cannot be denied. He controls all, physical and ethereal, regardless of time or place…
=====================================
NiGaSi-119: “It is said that there is a secret path leading to the Palace of Zarkhan underneath the Dworku Monastery...”
=====================================
NiGaSi-122: FIRST COMBINATION:
=====================================
NiGaSi-124: SECOND COMBINATION:
=====================================
NiGaSi-126: THIRD COMBINATION:
=====================================
NiGaSi-128: LAST COMBINATION?
=====================================
NiGaSi-136: The woman that I saw tonight in Vigoor... she was extremely beautiful... I must persevere to keep my wits about me. Perseverance... patience...
=====================================
NiGaSi-137: I encountered her again. That woman slays the beasts as if they were flies. The vicious way she fights is so unlike her beautiful appearance. A perfect example of extreme intensity... she is no ordinary female.
=====================================
NiGaSi-138: During a fight with the MSAT I slipped up and suffered a grave injury. I cannot reach my Black Spider brethren, my provisions are almost all gone, and my life is near its end. Death during an assignment is the wish of every Ninja, but we still have no clues regarding what happened to the evil Dark Dragon Blade. That is my only regret. All that is left is for me to trust my comrades, and accept these last painful moments as my destiny...
=====================================
NiGaSi-139: Although I have become so weak, I still await my death. Although I know It Is only a matter of time before I perish, I wish I could glimpse that woman one more time...
=====================================
NiGaSi-148: “A dark underground world, leading deeper and deeper. Does the path to Zarkhan truly exist?”
=====================================
NiGaSi-152: I have not seen the young one, Sabu, for several days now. It worries me, seeing as he is so inexperienced.
=====================================
NiGaSi-153: I have heard nothing from Suke yet. I do not believe that a Ninja as powerful as he could have been defeated. However, the unstable look on his face the last time we met was very much unlike his usual manner.
=====================================
NiGaSi-154: I was able to track down Doku, the Lord of Greater Fiends, but I was unable to lay even a finger on him. Burned by an evil blue fire, I accepted my fate. The blade gripped in the hands of that devil was none other than the Dark Dragon Blade, the artifact that, for 450 years, our Black Spider Clan has been searching for. My brothers, hurry! You must not allow the young Hayabusa to possess that awful power...
=====================================
NiGaSi-165: “The battle with Rachel's sister, the Greater Fiend Alma, ended without a victor. However, the aftermath of the battle has caused the Vigoor Army to be deployed...”
=====================================
NiGaSi-167: “The Vigoor Army is after a renegade element, Ryu. The Military Radio Tower is key to the Army’s organization...”
=====================================
NiGaSi-170: “The Army's organization has crumbled; there is no need for Ryu to stay in the now-silent capital...”
=====================================
NiGaSi-172: “Using the Aquaduct, Ryu has arrived at the moat surrounding Zarkhan. However, a great wall blocks his path into the Palace itself...”
=====================================
NiGaSi-175: I can't believe my first mission as a full-fledged Ninja is something so important! I feel the pride and honor of the Black Spider Clan. I\'m going to distinguish myself here and rise through the ranks.
=====================================
NiGaSi-176: Dear Mother, I have no more strength left, and I will die here, in this forsaken place. Although Ninja are taught patience and perseverance even in the face of death, I just don\'t want to die. Please, please, please...
=====================================
NiGaSi-181: “Rachel follows Lord Doku, who now takes the form of a vengeful spirit... As she enters the torn fabric of space and time, what horrors await her?”
=====================================
NiGaSi-185: “Although it appears as though Ryu defeated Doku, his vengeance is still incomplete. The Dark Dragon in the hands of the Holy Vigoor Emperor. What will become of Rachel and her sister?”
=====================================
NiGaSi-189: Everyone here trembles in fear. We witness a person turning into a Fiend. What is happening in this place? Even a Ninja as experienced as myself has no hope against these beasts…
=====================================
NiGaSi-190: I have discovered that the mastermind behind the plot to steal the Dark Dragon Blade is none other than the Holy Vigoor Emperor. Like our master, the Emperor must also be plotting to so something with the Blade...
=====================================
NiGaSi-191: What a disaster...the Dark Dragon Blade is cursed. I have been defeated, not by the enemy, but by the curse...
=====================================
NiGaSi-193: A metalworking mold in the shape of a cog.
=====================================
NiGaSi-194: A blasting furnace is visible beyond the wall.
=====================================
NiGaSi-196: All the pieces of the stone tablet have now been found. This complete tablet can be placed on the pedestal at the Twin Serpents Plaza in Tairon.
=====================================
NiGaSi-205: I'm hungry...(yes that's what it says!]
=====================================
NiGaSi-216: "Offer me up before the twin-headed serpent; use me as a key to open the path. There is another who travels the paths formed in the bowels of the Earth by Dragons. These paths together far away places, making them but a few steps away."
=====================================
NiGaSi-222: "The fate of the sisters has been decided. Ryu now head to the depths of Zarkhan, determined to fulfill his vengeance one and for all..."
=====================================
NiGaSi-230: I have arrived in Vigoor in search of the Dark Dragon Blade, leading a group of my comrades.
=====================================
NiGaSi-231: I have succeeded in infiltrating the Imperial Palace. I must accept that my comrades have all been slain...except for Dai, yes, he must certainly still be alive. I am sure he is hurrying to meet me at this moment, with the key to the Palace Core firmly I hand. I must join up with Dai as soon as possible, then plan out our attack on the Emperor.
=====================================
NiGaSi-232: While it may be true that the Dark Dragon Blade is formed out of dragon bones, one of the greatest delicacies in the ancient world, our master's plan to grind it up and use it for herbal tea is ridiculous. Of course I cannot tell anyone this, and therefore I must take this laughable secret with me to the grave...If we are forced to die for such goals as this, our Black Spider Clan will not last much longer. The Vigoor Emperor will gather his power and become the Devil on Earth, enslaving the human race for millennia to come...I have not been able to contact Dai, but it does not matter. His fate must be similar to mine...
=====================================
NiGaSi-235: “Doku's hate continues to slowly transform Ryu into a Fiend. Feeling the blood of the Fiends pounding in his veins, the Dragon Ninja stands before the gates to the source of all evil, the Core of the Imperial Palace!”
=====================================
NiGaSi-240: As a member of the Black Spider Clan, I will fulfill my mission and gain the respect of our clan leader. I have promised so to Gen, and I will not break that promise.
=====================================
NiGaSi-241: I have been badly wounded, but I have obtained the key to the Core. I do not have much longer; I must get this to Gen...
=====================================
NiGaSi-242: With this last bit of strength in me, I have made it this far. However, I cannot find a way to pass though this door...
=====================================
NiGaSi-256: “Ryu has defeated the evil Vigoor Emperor, and the Dark Dragon Blade is out of the reach of the Fiends. Now, Ryu must quickly escape the depths before the caverns come crashing down on him!”
=====================================
ReEv2(2-135: We're turning the station into a temporary shelter due to the massive sudden outbreak All police personnel have been instructed to make the safety of the citizens their top as we try to accommodate as many priority of them as possible.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-136: One of the refugees attacked us in the middle of the night, resulting in the death of 1 officer and injuring 3 others. The person in question quickly restrained. We believe this was simply a case of someone snapping under intense stress.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-137: A mob attacked the station today, resulting in a number of casualties. A few survivors were make it safely behind the emergency shutters, but surrounded as we are, it'll be hard for any of us to escape this place. We're not sure we can fix any of our comm equipment so we remain off from the outside world.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-138: There was another clash on the west side of the station around 1pm. Twelve people died, and there is only a handful of survivors left. Everything is falling into disarray in here.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-140: It appears that the keypad to the lockers terminal is missing a few keys. I suggest that the person responsible for this mess find some spare keys and fix this RIGHT NOW.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-143: Shotgun Shells Gunpowder+ High-Grade Gunpowder (Yellow]
=====================================
ReEv2(2-144: MAG Ammo High-Grade Gunpowder (Yellow) x2
=====================================
ReEv2(2-145: There's not a lot of ammo left around the station, so make good use of any gunpowder you find.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-146: Different guns require different ammo, so pay attention when you're combining things or you won't get what you need.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-148: Leon S. Kennedy, we're putting you on a very special case for your first assignment.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-149: Your mission is… to unlock your desk! The key to your success is in the initials of our first names. Input the letters in order of our desks. There are 2 locks-1 on each side of your desk. Make sure you get them both.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-150: Basically, your first task is to remember your fellow officers' names, but you figured that much out, right?
=====================================
ReEv2(2-151: Good luck, Leon.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-152: By the might take a little work to get Scott to give you a straight answer.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-155: September 28, 2:30 am
=====================================
ReEv2(2-156: It's down to just me and 3 others. No weapons… no ammo… and too many skirmishes have drained us mentally and physically. We're not gonna make it... Officer Phillips once suggested we escape through the sewers. Apparently, there's a secret tunnel under this place left over from its museum days.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-157: I brushed her idea off before, but now, it's not sounding all that bad. Yeah, there's no proof there's even a tunnel or that the sewers aren't infested with zombies, but I don't wanna sit here and wait to die, either. It's a long shot, but I'm gonna try to find out what I can about that tunnel.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-159: Humans have used herbs to treat sickness and disease since the dawn of time. In this book, we will explore three such herbs native to the Arklay Mountains.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-160: Green herbs have the ability to heal basic injuries, while blue herbs have long been used to treat poisoning.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-161: As for red herbs, while they are visually appealing, they offer no medicinal benefits. Or so it was thought until recently.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-162: It's well-known that combining herbs together produces blends that heighten the herbs' effects, but it has been discovered that red herbs can play a big role when mixed properly.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-163: According to one doctor of Asian medicine mixing blue and red herbs together produces a blend that will strengthen one's constitution.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-164: Truly, we have only just begun to realize the full potential of these herbs and their ability to heal the human body. Further research is sure to yield even more fascinating results.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-166: Press a button to light up its corresponding lamp. Light them all to open the safe.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-167: The buttons must be pressed in a certain order. Pressing a single button out of order will cause all of the lights to go out and you will need to start the sequence over again.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-171: Consider this a gift for anyone still unfortunate enough to be alive.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-172: Keep your eyes peeled for those creepy fucks that look like they were skinned alive- "lickers," we call 'em. They're blind as bats, but their hearing more than makes up for that.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-173: So long as you don't run around like a total idiot, guns a-blazing, you should be able to slip right by them… probably.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-174: Either way, make like my grandma and creep around as slow as possible around 'em, yeah?
=====================================
ReEv2(2-175: Anyway, not that I wanna go, but duty calls. That, and I've got a friend to avenge.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-177: Damn those corporate assholes! They cut me off! After all I've done for them! But if that's how it's gonna be, so be it. I'm gonna have a little fun of my own as the world goes to shit.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-178: I boarded all those filthy pigs up in a steel pen, and set some C4. All I gotta do is detonate it and it's "sayonara suckers!"
=====================================
ReEv2(2-179: But it's no fun if it's over too soon, so maybe I'll give that one raving loon something to really squeal about.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-180: Yeah, maybe I'll give him a little toy and tell him, “Kill the guy next to you and I'll spare the others.” I wonder what he'll do.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-181: You yell about “justice” and “pride” but how many times did you go against me, your own superior?
=====================================
ReEv2(2-182: Yeah, you're such a good cop... So good you had to die.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-183: Man is this fun. I need some music for this.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-191: The building in the center of town wasn't always a police station-in fact, it used to be an art museum. Various features like the unusual clock tower and the goddess statue in the main hall remind of bygone era.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-192: Just a few blocks from the police station is an orphanage founded and run by the Umbrella Corporation with the help of generous donations from businesses and citizens alike. The building is known for its stained glass window, which attracts visitors from around the world.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-205: The ruby that captivated Edward the Black Prince, the pearl that the queen of the Nile milked dry, the diamond that lead a queen to the guillotine there is no end to the number of tales related to the appeal of jewels.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-206: This mysterious red stone is simply the latest to sparkle among them.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-207: Like those other jewels, this one's origin is unknown. It's said that it once adorned a noblewoman's jeweled box and was even dedicated to a wise king.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-208: This fall, this stone that's long been shrouded in legend will be on display during auction. There are sure to be many eager enthusiasts there.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-209: But, dear reader, one would do well to approach with care, for devilry lies in beauty's shadow. This jewel has turned caring nobles who love their subjects into despots more terrible than Caligula, and we have the tales prove it. Seriously, it's precisely because these jewels are bathed in blood that their luster stirs something in the hearts of people everywhere.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-239: Office Supply Internal Relocation Notice
=====================================
ReEv2(2-240: Heat-resistant 3-number combination safe Moved from S.T.A.R.S. Office (2F) to West Office (1F]
=====================================
ReEv2(2-241: Please change the combo ASAP upon receipt.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-242: R.P.D. Facility Maintenance Dept.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-304: The power panel is out. Can the person in charge of it please take care of it ASAP!?
=====================================
ReEv2(2-305: I assume everyone knows, but since the jail's power panel is old as hell, we're gonna need those custom power panel parts no one makes anymore. There should be a few in the generator room.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-309: Item to be Disposed:
=====================================
ReEv2(2-312: Howdy boys and girls! It's your pal from the Raccoon City Zoo! It's always great to see you!
=====================================
ReEv2(2-313: Today, I want to talk about something really important to me. You know my popular Mr. Raccoon toys? Well, I heard some bad kids have been using them for target practice, but that makes me really sad…
=====================================
ReEv2(2-314: Good little kids wouldn't be that mean, right? Plus it's super super dangerous, so just don't do.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-317: Male, Caucasian, 39 years old
=====================================
ReEv2(2-319: Deceased was a known kleptomaniac, incarcerated multiple times. Incredibly, he Would steal even while in jail, though that was consistent with his clinical diagnosis.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-328: Can't believe he tried to pull a fast one in a police station, of all places, though…
=====================================
ReEv2(2-332: Due to the high cultural value of the bell, I'm calling a specialist in to make the repairs. Will go over the details once they're on the scene, but in the meantime, I'll take steps to secure the bell since the yoke is threatening to break.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-337: The station's swarming with monsters. Even here I can hear their cries. But it's not the zombies I'm afraid of.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-339: The ultimate bioweapon, developed by those bastards in the utmost secrecy. To think that that thing might be wandering around here…
=====================================
ReEv2(2-340: Chances are they've ordered it to wipe out the witnesses.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-475: I already put in a request last week, but absolutely must have a replacement we ID wristband ASAP. We need one to gain access to certain areas of the main facility. In other words, me and my crew can't get to the places we need to in order to do our job right now, so I don't want to hear anyone accusing us of slacking off.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-481: With the new wristband that's just arrived, we finally begin our survey of the demolition can area. As to the report from the other day about the incinerator, it's nothing really-probably just large piece of leftover trash. I'll go take a a look myself after I wrap up this report.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-511: Director Owens,
=====================================
ReEv2(2-512: There are alarms going off all over NEST. I don't know what's going on, but I can hear gunfire and I can't reach my section chief. We're trapped. Please send help ASAP.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-513: Director Owens,
=====================================
ReEv2(2-514: The situation here is dire. NEST has been contaminated with the virus. It's unbelievable. The failsafe system didn't activate at all. Is this the work of outsiders? I can't imagine who else it could be. But why? Mayer and Kim are dead. I can't stop coughing. Why won't you answer me!?
=====================================
ReEv2(2-515: Director Owens,
=====================================
ReEv2(2-521: Thank you for your interest in Knights Construction Company. Over the past 20 years, we have had the honor to work on the sewer systems of some of our country's losing sight of greatest cities, while never our two core principles of "playfulness" and "superior industrial design."
=====================================
ReEv2(2-522: At KCC, we believe that just because our work is subterranean doesn't mean our designs have to be sub-par.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-523: More refined than a queen, more polished than a knight, and as pleasant as a pawn, our work is sure to bring great victory to everyone involved!

ReEv2(2-533: I lost the thing that tells you how to unlock the door to the U-Area during that last mad dash of a transfer. I know you have to stick plug into each terminal, but if anyone one remembers which plug goes where, please be a pal and share by posting the info on this board.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-535: “Pretty sure the rook and knight are on the same wall and the bishop and queen aren't next to each other. The queen and rook were opposite each other, too.”

ReEv2(2-542: How are you all doing in that drab, old station? Hanging in there against old Irons? Me? I just got back from a date with a hot we got up chick. Bet you can guess what to under her extra-large umbrella.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-543: Europe is amazing. One month in no way enough to even scratch the surface. Maybe I'll extend my vacation for another six months.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-544: Barry, don't even think of coming to join me Wouldn't want to make all the cute girls cry yeah? So you just leave the babes to me.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-545: Jill, if Claire tries to contact you, please let her know I'm OK.

ReEv2(2-611: This research facility uses the latest security technology in order to ensure employee safety and efficient business practices.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-612: In order to enter and exit the facility, and to operate certain equipment, employees must use an ID Wristband.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-613: There are three levels of access:
=====================================
ReEv2(2-614: Authentication is granted based on an electronic chip inside the wristband. wristband access level can be changed by simply inserting a different electronic chip.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-615: Visitor wristbands can be given to family members of employees. Please enquire at reception for further details.
=====================================

=====================================
ReEv2(2-638: -Doctor Birkin, you'll come along with us quietly.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-646: 1. Place an empty cartridge into the Solution Dispenser
=====================================
ReEv2(2-647: Plant 43 exhibits astounding growth. If something unfortunate were to occur, it may be hard to control. In the event of an unforeseen incident manufacture the herbicide using the instructions above in order to minimize damage.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-649: Everybody's turned… vegefied... They keep coming back, again and again.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-650: Burn them all.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-651: Burn them until their whole body is black as ash.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-656: Can you believe that bastard Cartwright? Cool your jets, asshole! Well, I guess he is the boss... For now. Anyway, have you seen my helix anywhere? I put the secret on the bottom. Let me know if you find it!
=====================================
ReEv2(2-662: We're under attack. People are dead. The East Area is cut off. We can't operate the bridge with the wristbands we have here. Where is that bastard Cartwright hiding!?
=====================================
ReEv2(2-665: Plant 43 is going wild! The Greenhouse is hell! We need to send someone in there before it's too late. Wayne, how do we stop this thing? You have to help us. Please reply!
=====================================
ReEv2(2-668: Do you remember Susie, the cheerleader? What a great gal. We were both into her. Of course, she wasn't into nerds... I still have to give you back those comics and games borrowed. But you might have to wait a while.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-683: When did NEST become a "nest" for spies? Three last month, and another four this month. And those are just the ones we caught. Step up security, Cartwright. Or do you want to end up like your predecessor?
=====================================
ReEv2(2-684: Also, I'll be restricting access to the West Area from today. Ignore all requests from headquarters for information on "G." Those suits contribute nothing to this project anyway.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-687: Herbicide dispersal by unauthorized employee detected in the East Area.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-688: 04:51 Wayne Li
=====================================
ReEv2(2-706: The Umbrella Corporation has decided to cease all research on "G," which was ongoing at the NEST underground laboratory. All funding for this project has been cut, and laboratory director William Birkin has been removed from his post.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-709: Thank you for your mail, Dr. Birkin. Top brass has expressed an interest in this "evolving bioweapon" you mentioned. Do not worry about Costs. Our "company" is the most well-funded in the whole of the United States.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-712: I heard the good news. "G" is almost ready thought to report to the Strange you never research lab here at Umbrella HQ… but suppose I can let that slide. Anyway, send over the data, would you?
=====================================
ReEv2(2-713: And don't worry. You've done good work on "G," but we can take care of the rest.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-714: Please respond to the investigation committee's summons within 24 hours.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-716: Embryo Growth Observations (Subject 449]
=====================================
ReEv2(2-717: After the G embryo was implanted in the subject we made a 50cm incision from the chest to the abdomen and began our observations. With the help of the medical team, the subject's consciousness level was kept between 15 (lucid)~GCS 10. However, the subject's consciousness level deteriorated, and further observation was deemed unnecessary. The subject was then disposed of.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-718: Breeding Rate Observations (Subject 501]
=====================================
ReEv2(2-719: The G-Virus was administered to subject 501. 501 mutated into G form and was introduced to a group of 30 test subjects. After 2 hours 36 minutes, it was observed that all but one of the test subjects had been implanted with an embryo. All subjects (One subject broke down during experimentation were disposed of and took their own life.]
=====================================
ReEv2(2-720: T-Virus Resistance Experimentation (Subjects 628, 639]
=====================================
ReEv2(2-721: We administered the G-Virus to subject 628, who had shown slight resistance to the T-Virus. The virus was then introduced to subject 639 with whom 628 had a close relationship. 628 showed some signs of resistance, but had been implanted with an embryo after 24 minutes. T-Virus resistance does nothing to stop the mental deterioration caused by the G-Virus.
=====================================
ReEv2(2-1139: “Express elevator to Chief's Office. Not for general use.”
=====================================
ReEv2(2-1305: “Pretty sure the rook and knight are on the same wall and the bishop and queen aren't next to each other. The queen and rook were opposite each other, too.”
=====================================
ReEv3(2-2: ﻿[The game starts with frightening footage from real news channels, telling about the spread of some terrible infection. These kind of footage are shown on all channels.]
=====================================
ReEv3(2-19: It's already been two months since that mess with Umbrella. Thanks to the suspension, investigations haven't progressed exactly as I'd hoped. Perhaps this written record of what I've found will prove to be my final duty as a S.T.A.R.S. officer… I can only hope that it helps lead to the truth.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-20: Those infected by this virus seem to become literal zombies. It appears to be communicable via several different avenues, outlined below:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-21: - Bite from an infected individual, allowing the mixing of bodily fluids
=====================================
ReEv3(2-22: - Contact with crows which have eaten infected carrion
=====================================
ReEv3(2-23: - Due to the strength of the virus, airborne infection cannot be discounted
=====================================
ReEv3(2-24: It should be noted that those who survived the incident have not yet developed symptoms.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-25: It's unclear whether this is because the virus has a long incubation period, or because we just happened to be resistant to the infection. We ought to remain vigilant, even after this investigation period ends.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-26: As for me—aside from my minor difficulties sleeping—I seem to be in fine shape. Still, a shouldn't get too hopeful. After all, this could just be an extended incubation.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-28: Pharmaceuticals company, industry leader in market share
=====================================
ReEv3(2-29: - Focuses on military weapons development while maintaining cover as a pharmaceutical company
=====================================
ReEv3(2-30: - Also secretly developing bioweapons
=====================================
ReEv3(2-31: T-Virus outbreak at Arklay Mountains research facility

ReEv3(2-32: - Predicted the “mansion incident”
=====================================
ReEv3(2-33: Conspiring with Raccoon City leadership
=====================================
ReEv3(2-35: They've got pinned down at home. Guys cross the street are watching me from their window 24/7. Are they Iron’s men? Umbrella's? I don't know, and there's no real difference anyway.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-36: I know what they're trying to do. They wan to r me down, torment me into compliance, and it's working. I'm barely eating, barely I'm going crazy.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-37: I feel like the living dead.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-38: But I won't let em win. I have to get out of the city and find way to make them accountable. They'll send someone to silence me, of course. If you hear that I've been killed… or whatever it is they do to people like me… you MUST pick up the investigation where I left off. I've enclosed files. They'll tell you everything you need to now, as long as this package isn't intercepted.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-40: Hey hotshot, how you holding up? I still can't believe Irons suspended you. It's such bullshit. He ought to pin a medal on you for making it out of that hellhole back in July. Of course you're going to poke around and ask questions about it.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-41: I hope you're not mad at me for keeping my head down. Everything's been happening so fast... S.T.A.R.S. was the pride of the force. When the chief disbanded us out of nowhere, I thought for sure I was going to lose my job.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-42: Word has it you're planning to leave Raccoon City? I figured you wouldn't take the suspension lying down. Just promise to watch your back. Umbrella won't sit by while you try to dismantle their business. Take care, Jill.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-43: S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team (now and forever]
=====================================
ReEv3(2-44: P.S. Had to slip this message to the pizza guy to avoid detection. Enjoy the extra large Mega Meat Supreme! It's on me and the guys.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-45: September 28, 8:07 p.m. - Raccoon City [The phone on the nightstand next to the bed starts ringing.]
=====================================
ReEv3(2-161: On the battlefield, if, you run out of ammo, your gun's useful as a wet fart.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-162: Want to stay alive out there? Then get these basic formulas into you skull.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-163: Handgun Ammo:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-164: Shotgun Shells:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-165: MAG Ammo:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-166: Once you're stocked up; get out there and join the party! Let's give those dead motherfuckers something to eat! Just make sure you don't come dessert.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-169: In the gray of the morning on September 25th, a frantic caller telephoned the R.P.D. to report an assault; a man described as “disheveled, like a vagrant” was attacking a passerby north of the Lambs Museum of Art. The responding officers discovered the mutilated corpse of a woman by some dumpsters nearby. Dozens of bite marks covered her body and she had been dismembered, suggesting she had been eaten—the third known incident of its kind to occur in Raccoon City this month.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-170: So whodunit? Who’s been munching on man-steak? We here at News Comet have a gnawing feeling that the so-called "cannibal disease" patients Spencer Memorial has been providing free treatment for since August might not be settling for just the cafeteria food.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-171: Our reporters have infiltrated Spencer Memorial, asked the tough questions, and come back with horror stories that will 'make your stomach roil. Turn the page for the scoop.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-180: There's no place in the U.B.C.S. for pipsqueaks who crawl back to base eve single time they get scratched up. You want somebody to kiss your boo-boo, go someplace else!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-181: Here in the big leagues, we mix our own meds, so get these recipes memorized!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-182: High Potency Mixture:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-183: Maximum Potency Mixture:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-184: First-Aid Spray:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-185: Can’t make these yourself. Grab ‘em if you see ‘em!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-186: That should do it. Now let’s get this done and then go grab a beer!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-201: This new hair tonic from Umbrella is just flying off the shelves! The stuff they make always works wonders, so it's no surprise. I was counting on this and ordered a huge shipment. My instincts are paying off—literally! I just know sales will continue to rise as word gets out.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-202: That said, the string of violent incidents on the news has me worried. Maybe I ought to invest in a good safe to hold all this cash that's rolling in.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-203: The new safe is just perfect. Nobody knows the code, not even my wife.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-204: It's a secret between me and my beautiful Aqua Cure queen...
=====================================
ReEv3(2-205: And she'd never give it up for a thief!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-209: In the even of a power outage, the subway will, automatically cease operation . Once power has
=====================================
ReEv3(2-210: been restored, please use the control panel to confirm the stations at which the train will stop, well as which track segments will be used.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-211: If the route entered is unsafe, an error will occur and operations will not resume.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-213: Violence getting worse and worse these past few days. Got a shotgun for when it hits a breaking point.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-214: Locking it up in the gun rack. That should keep it safe from any would-be looters while I go out and try to find some more shells.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-215: If things go south, cut the chain and bust out that sucker. I pray we all make it out alive.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-235: Suck it, prison! The Umbrella Corporation just recruited me for a job. A JOB! Don't know how they're gonna wipe out a life sentence for murdering twenty gangbangers, but whatever. I'll take it. Beats shitting away the rest of my days behind bars.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-236: I gotta get back into shape.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-237: Target practice at 400 yds, 5 misses
=====================================
ReEv3(2-238: Caught the chain yesterday and got moved to a U.B.C.S. training camp, where I fired my first bullet in two whole years. Missed a stationary target by 5 inches at 400 yards—I never fucking do that! It's like I forgot everything.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-239: Target practice at 600 yds, 2 misses OK, I've got my shot grouping down to 3 inches. Feeling good, feeling good. After lunch, they put me through my first mock battle. The cap and the other guys are good people, and goddamn beasts of war at that, but what the fuck is up with that lunatic Nicholai? He used me a fucking human shield just to score some extra points.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-241: Now that Jill's got the bolt cutters, she's explore areas previously closed to her. She's arming herself with a shotgun.]
=====================================
ReEv3(2-243: The Middle East, Eastern Europe, East Africa… I thought I knew what hell was. Figured I'd never crack, no matter what was thrown at me.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-244: A quick wage. I'd earned it.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-245: It all happened at once. There were 30 guys in our squad, all 'armed with state-of-the-art assault rifles, and yet we were wiped out in less than 48 hours.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-246: I've been through enough shit to know it only ever gets worse. And if that was just the beginning...
=====================================
ReEv3(2-247: Maybe I'm a coward. I don't care. This is the only way out I have left. I just hope my body doesn't get back up after I pull the trigger.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-249: Public-use Generators Provided Raccoon City Electrician's Guild
=====================================
ReEv3(2-252: You got that? If you see a generator spitting sparks, don't go near it! Don't do anything stupid! Safety first, as the saying goes. If we make it through this mess, I'll have plenty of busted generators for sale at bargain prices!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-254: In response the violent outbreaks across the city, have implemented an intentional power outage.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-255: On the situation has been brought under control, please activate the four breakers ASAP. Once that's done, turn on the main power switch in the control room to reactivate the power grid.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-259: It was starting to look like Chad was never gonna come back from his rounds, so I poked my head in there… and fuck me—next thing I know I've got some kinda maggots squirming down my throat!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-261: My gramma once told me that green herbs are a natural bug deterrent. So I grabbed one, shoved it down my gob and swallowed… and whaddaya know, the little things didn't want to be in there anymore. I've never been so happy to throw up!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-264: The key to the area has gone missing, and the earliest we'll a replacement in is next week. In the interim, a lockpick will be provided to the senior employee on duty.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-265: We only have one lockpick and cannot afford to lose it, so please keep it in its carrying case at all times when you're not using it.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-266: An please, could you all check just once more that you did not accidentally take he key home? If you happen to find it, please bring it to Kate in Admin.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-337: We've been receiving reports of unauthorized personnel in the control areas of the facility. In response, we are replacing the aging mechanical locks a d implementing new security protocols.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-338: Unlocking the new electric locks requires a special-made battery pack, to be distributed to all employees. Please keep your personal battery pack on hand at all times when moving throughout the facility.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-346: Gammas released from tank for the first time. Movements sluggish. Combat potential low.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-348: Experimented with additional hormones and drugs. One adjustment bore positive results, with a significant rise in combat potential. Specmen is now able to move quickly and swallow prey whole.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-350: Umbrella as officially shut down Gamma research. We managed to smuggle some specimens with especially high potential from the lab before disposal. Dr. Logan Carlisle is more committed than ever to perfecting the Gamma line.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-354: We were lucky to secure this space by bribing the sewage department chief, but it's beginning to feel cramped due to the Gammas' continued growth. We should begin to consider other possible arrangements.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-356: A water treatment worker found his way into the lab, but the Gammas promptly eliminated him. This proves their viability for field use. I'll reach out to Umbrella's European branch tomorrow; perhaps they will see the light.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-358: Thank you for purchasing the ХХХХХХХ grenade launcher.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-359: We've made special adjustments to this piece to ensure compatibility with a variety of ammunition types. For optimal performance, be sure to choose the right ammo for, the right situation.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-360: As we discussed at the time of purchase, this is a refurbished model, and the chamber needs to be manually cycled between shots. It'll take an extra moment, but this is reflected in the price, as agreed.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-367: It happened again. They got Kane this time. I saw it all! One of those things just… swallowed him whole, head to toe.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-368: I tried to warn them when Bill went missing two weeks back. The cops said he'd probably skipped town, but I said no way! Not with his baby coming any day! But did they listen? Nope!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-369: This is bullshit! Fucking puke-breathing, toad-faced motherfuckers! Every time I think I've lost them, another one pops out of the tunnels!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-370: And it's not like I can count on the fucking cops! Don't trust those pencil-pushers at HQ either. Next time one of those freaks shows its face, I'm gonna hit it right in its big ugly mouth!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-373: My little darlings,
=====================================
ReEv3(2-374: It’s already been three months since we fled here together. I find myself thinking back to the day you hatched... Your little voices made me tremble with pride...
=====================================
ReEv3(2-375: Your adorable little bodies, brimming with Incredible, destructive power... And, of course, that voracious, insatiable appetite. You are no less than the pinnacle of the Hunter series! And yet they ordered me to destroy you! They said you were unfit for use as weapons because of a few minor vulnerabilities!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-376: So what if you’re susceptible to heat? So what if your delicate mandibles are exposed when you feed? Haven't they ever heard of CHARACTER FLAWS? It is those very flaws hat make you so very, very precious to me.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-377: But we'll show them yet. Down here we'll continue walk this evolutionary path together! We'll prove to Umbrella that you, my beloved Hunter Gammas, are truly superior!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-387: We have decided to delay the Barnaby Office Building demolition in response to ongoing public unrest. For safety reasons, all electrical equipment, including generators, have been moved to the roof for safekeeping.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-388: Entry to the premises is prohibited until the current unrest has subsided. All employees are to stay at home and await further instructions.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-415: I'm writing to you because I am troubled, deeply troubled. Anyone who's been a parent knows that Crystal Promenade is THE place to take your kids for a trip downtown on Saturdays. And there's no store more popular (or harder on a parent's wallet) than Toy Uncle. However, I've noticed that on windy days, the big statue above the entrance wobbles like, the only thing holding it up is couple of screws.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-416: If that statue's head tumbles loose on a busy day, children will be badly hurt. I've complained to they manager three times now, but he just isn't willing to rectify the situation.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-417: Are we supposed to wait for a terrible accident to happen before taking action? No. If heads are going to roll, then let it be the manager's. Take that death trap down.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-452: September 29, 2:11 a.m. - Subway Car

ReEv3(2-510: Charges:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-511: Narrative:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-512: Suspect was seen behaving suspiciously at 1442 Box St. on Sept. 18, 1998. Suspect’s person was searched, producing a small explosive and a timed detonator from his inside pocket, leading to arrest on the charges listed above. A search of suspect’s home found more than 20 additional homemade explosives at various stages of completion.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-513: Suspect was extremely agitated and not of sound mind. Suspect spoke feverishly when questioning began, and at one point, questioning had be halted to a sudden bout of shrieking fro suspect. Once questioning was resumed, suspect made the following statements:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-514: “I didn't do it for me, did it for you! Why doesn't anyone understand? The corpses attack from the shadows!”
=====================================
ReEv3(2-515: "A storm's coming, but this umbrella is no good! Gotta blow it up or you'll be more than just wet! Gotta get more bombs!"
=====================================
ReEv3(2-516: “They're coming. Soon. Gotta hurry. Burn 'em. Burn the corpses. Bu 'em good.”
=====================================
ReEv3(2-517: During questioning, the began to shake violently before resuming a shrieking fit. Questioning was ended, and a sedative administered.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-518: Note:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-519: Due to suspect's unstable psychiatric condition, suspect's testimony changed from moment to moment. Suspect delirium made any sort of dialogue impossible. We are currently awaiting the results of a doctor's investigation into suspect's condition. The explosives collected from suspect's person and residence appear to be extremely powerful. As a safety precaution, a battery was removed from one detonation device upon its admission int evidence.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-522: Office Supply Internal Relocation Notice
=====================================
ReEv3(2-523: Heat-resistant 3-number combination safe moved from S.T.A.R.S. Office (2F) to West Office (1F).
=====================================
ReEv3(2-530: Hector:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-531: If you're reading this, I'm already dead. If you hear my noises coming from the locker, DO NOT OPEN IT. Please.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-532: While you were out on patrol, I focused on finding a way to get to the other side. I realized that explosives might be our best bet. I managed to rig up a pretty good bomb, but we don't have any batteries for the detonator. I'm pretty sure I sent one to the safety deposit room during intake last week. We need that battery if we're going to knock this wall down, so I headed upstairs to find you since I know you have the safety deposit room key.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-533: As soon as I left the shower room, I was attacked. One of them bit me... I washed the wound as best I could but I feel worse and worse. I hope I don't need to spell out why you must not open the locker... Please don't worry about me. Just get yourself out of here as fast as you can.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-534: Your buddy,
=====================================
ReEv3(2-535: Wes.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-536: P.S. Don't worry about that $600 I lent you. Think of it as a gift towards your upcoming move. Good luck, buddy.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-553: This bizarre incident occurred in a mansion owned by the Umbrella Corporation located Arklay Mountains.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-554: On July 3, S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team was dispatched to the Arklay Mountains to investigate a series of mysterious and grisly murders, and went unexpectedly radio silent.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-555: On July 24, Alpha Team was dispatched as well, and became entangled in the events at the nearby mansion.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-556: The incident culminated in the destruction of the mansion. Casualties were numerous. The only survivors were five members of S.T.A.R.S. of the incident was the illegal bioweapon experiments being carried out in a secret Umbrella lab beneath the mansion. The T-Virus being used in these experiments escaped the facility, and is presumed to be the root cause of all that occurred.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-557: However, all evidence was destroyed along with the mansion, so further investigation has proven to be extremely difficult.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-562: September 29, 4:43 a.m. S.T.A.R.S. Office
=====================================
ReEv3(2-567: Good news, limpdicks!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-569: - Mine Rounds are designed for standard-issue Grenade Launchers. Don't get cute and try to load 'em in anything else.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-570: - Fire them walls or the stay right where you put 'em.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-571: - The sensor in the mine will detect approaching enemies and detonate when and they get within range.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-572: So basically, just toss 'em in an enemy's path, and you've got yourself a landmine! There's no such thing as 'unfair' when you those giant freaks, so get out there and fight dirty!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-576: Saint Michael's Clock Tower is a Baroque-style building which stands at the heart of Raccoon City. It has become beloved icon, and residents consider it to be emblematic of the city as a whole.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-577: Saint Michael's Church erected this tower in 1908 with the assistance of several philanthropists. It was dedicated to the children born in the developing city, and the first floor was used as an elementary school for many years. The city saw further growth during its electrification over the course of the early 20th century, and body of Saint Michael's Elementary swelled to over 600 students.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-578: Unfortunately, Saint Michael's Elementary was shuttered in 1978 as the building began to show signs of age and wear. The clock was deactivated, and strict limitations were placed on entry to the surrounding premises. Years passed with this once-beloved monument and public plaza on lockdown, but in the 1990s the Umbrella Corporation worked in league with Mayor Michael Warren to renovate and reopen the area, this time with proper preservation efforts in place. The clock tower was officially reopened in 1993, and today the sound of its heavy, tolling bells can once again be heard throughout Raccoon City.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-608: September 29, 9:20 p.m. - Spencer Memorial Hospital
=====================================
ReEv3(2-618: Every day, they bring in more of these "mystery illness" patients. The sedatives don't stop their delirium, so we have to put them in straitjackets and move them to the isolation wing. Problem is, the isolation wing is already bursting at the seams. The director has ordered us to admit anyone with symptoms free of charge, but does he expect us to do? Wish them better? We don't have a core.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-619: And that's not all that's bothering me. When these patients die, they're not collected by the usual mortuary teams. We've been told it's "special handling" to prevent the illness from spreading, but I'm not sure I buy it. Miranda saw some guys wheeling a body through the "forbidden door" during the night. Why? Where? What is going on?
=====================================
ReEv3(2-624: · Admitted over 20 "mystery illness" patients
=====================================
ReEv3(2-625: · Patients in the isolation wing exhibiting severe limb necrosis, fever, muttering delirium, and signs of hyperphagia
=====================================
ReEv3(2-626: · Possible infection? Tried every antiseptic
=====================================
ReEv3(2-627: Dr. Young was bitten while treating one of the patients. We've disinfected the wound, but his fever won't go down. Nothing works. Meanwhile, the outpatient wing is complete anarchy. The patients are delirious and growing more violent by the minute.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-628: We've called in our off-duty staff. It's all hands on deck now. We have got to contain this chaos!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-630: ID cards are not to be taken off hospital grounds under any circumstances. As per our security measures, all employees must store their ID card in their own personal lockers before returning home for the day.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-631: Thank you.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-632: The key to the locker room has gone missing. The person to have it may have dropped it somewhere in the courtyard. Until It is recovered, we will keep a spare key here in the office. Please stop by administration at the end of your shift to borrow it.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-634: We tried. I swear to God we did. But there's nothing else to be done. The chaos is completely beyond control. Victims are pouring in now, dying and spreading the infection faster than we can reach them.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-635: So we've given up trying. Those of us who aren't infected have barricaded ourselves in here. We can hear the cries for help outside. The screaming... But none of us will go out there, because it would be the end of us.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-636: I can't believe we've abandoned our patients... It's the worst sin imaginable for a nurse. I can't stop shaking. But I want to live. I want to live.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-637: We heard a helicopter flying overhead and immediately started crying and hugging each other, thinking a rescue team was on the way.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-638: But then the sound grew distant, and all we're left with now is the moaning of the dead and the silent screams in our hearts. We're all about to lose our minds.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-639: Dr. Young, Ariana, Miranda, Dakota... I'm so sorry I failed you...
=====================================
ReEv3(2-643: Dakota,
=====================================
ReEv3(2-644: I think I know what happened to the missing tape of Dr. B. His research assistant took it. One of the patients saw Abbott remove something from a locker in the Nurses Station and walk toward the treatment room. I'll try to sneak in and look during the night shift. You just stay cool and keep doing your job.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-645: I don’t care how important Dr. B is to the medical community. That kind of harassment is not OK. I promise I won't let them destroy the evidence. and an asshole and will get his day. He's in a court.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-646: Stay brave. Stay strong.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-650: To all employees:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-651: We've bee inundated with reports of lost items. If you find something and it is unclear who it belongs to, do not take it home. Please deposit it in the Nurses Station safe.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-652: The safe combination is:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-653: Thank you for your cooperation.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-669: It is my pleasure to cordially invite you to a banquet on Sept. 10 at the Central Hotel, where we will be exchanging viewpoints on Raccoon City's new Special Medical Zone (SMZ). Attending will be Mayor Michael Warren, Chief of Police, Brian Irons, and other distinguished members of our community.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-670: Sincerely,
=====================================
ReEv3(2-671: Nate, I'll be introducing the bill for that new drug of yours in mid-August. Bring t cash. We've booked a suite for the usual afterparty. You're a brunette guy, right? I'll let Irons know.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-675: Greg, I know you're watching the news. This virus is going to devour the whole country. The dead will wash over Capitol Hill like a tidal wave. You're not safe. However, you've always been a good friend to me, so I'd like to offer you a way out.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-676: I have in my possession ONE dose of a vaccine for the virus. The holy grail! And it's not for my family, not for my ladies on the side. No, Greg, I'm saving it for YOU. I know better than anyone that you're the future of the United States. But if you want the goods, Greg, you have got to get me the hell out of here NOW, without Umbrella finding out.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-677: Lean on the Pentagon for me. I know you've got the clout. See if someone can get a rescue team in here without U.B.C.S. involvement. You scratch my back, I scratch yours—which should sound pretty chaste after the parties we've been to. Hurry. My time is running out.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-733: October 1, 12:03 a.m. - Spencer Memorial Hospital
=====================================
ReEv3(2-751: To all employees:
=====================================
ReEv3(2-752: We’ve identified an issue with the electrical box where concurrent use of heavy machinery overloads it and causÅ the fuses to blow. If you encounter this problem and can't get the elevator running, please stay calm, gather fuses from the sub-generators situated around the warehouse, and use those to restore power from the main generator as quickly as possible.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-767: Disposals trending upwards daily.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-768: Nightly transfer observed by nurse.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-769: Admissions to underground facility temporarily halted.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-773: 1300. Infiltrated RC. Disturbances are sporadic. Commencing mission.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-774: 1930. Observed five R.P.D. officers engaging a pack 20 strong. Officers annihilated in 20 min.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-775: 1200. Test run at university. Diverted pack (incl. canines) to campus. 64% infection and conversion in hrs. No survivors.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-776: 2300. Successful rendezvous with MV Platoon. Will make first attempt at dawn.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-778: 1800. Unknown bioweapon deployed at Point D18. Tracking it per orders. It appears to be on the hunt.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-780: 0000. Female JV has made contact with MV Platoon. Bioweapon's appearance and behavior are consistent with Project N. Investigating.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-781: 0400. Observed bioweapon wielding conventional weapons. It seems to be strongly fixated on terminating JV and knows the city layout. Evidence it can be imprinted?
=====================================
ReEv3(2-782: 0700. Metamorphosis in the bioweapon triggered by a hostile encounter with JV (video attached). JV has been infected and is non-responsive. Collected samples per orders.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-783: 0030. Over 17 hours have elapsed since JV's exposure to virus. Conversion has been slow, suggesting she may be resistant.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-784: 0400. Vaccine recovered and administered to JV by CO, a soldier in MV Platoon. JV expected to be fit for combat approx. 20 hrs post-exposure. It seems clear the bioweapon is Project N. Contact with JV causes it to change and evolve. Will induce further encounters to obtain more precise data.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-809: The objectives of this T-Virus research facility differ from those of Umbrella's main NEST facility. Here we focus on real-world use cases which arise new bioweapons are created and introduced, such as the need for T-Virus vaccines, and new weaponry capable of suppressing bioweapons.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-810: Some aspects of our work here can be dangerous, so it is imperative that all employees adhere to workplace regulations without fail. In particular, unauthorized entry by unapproved visitors, or the removal of work-related data or materials will be met with severe disciplinary measures.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-811: It is a great honor to be part of the finest research organization in the world. Keep this in mind and stick to the rules as we forge new and revolutionary technologies.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-813: The pay was generous, the benefits were good. Most importantly, they promised me I'd be contributing to state-of-the-art medical tech research. For a university teacher stuck working in Nowhere, America, it was a golden opportunity, like winning the lottery. So I went for it. I made— the pitch to my family and we agreed to move here to Raccoon City.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-814: Well, hindsight is 20/20, because this lab is a den of monsters who conduct cruel and barbaric experiments for the sole purpose of taking human life in the most sickening way possible.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-815: It's messed up. The world needs to know. But every time I work up enough courage to blow the whistle, I think of Penny and Casey and immediately chicken out.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-816: Umbrella owns this town. There was this guy they caught trying to smuggle out company secrets. They essentially fed him to one of the Betas. FED HIM. I saw the whole thing.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-817: I got my wife and daughter into this. I just need to do my job. Do as I'm told. For their sake. But let this be testament that I do have a conscience, and that I've learned my lesson.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-829: I would like to formally request that the weaponry normally reserved for the Bioweapon Synthesis Team be made available for any employees interfacing with the admission and dismissal of test subjects. These test subjects do not present the same levels of danger as our bioweapon products, but I believe that this weaponry authorization is advisable as outlined below.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-830: Recently, some test subjects have developed a new mutation granting them very high regrowth abilities, Our team refers to these specimens as "Pale Heads." They have been appearing with regularity, but the specific cause has not yet been determined. The astonishing rate at which these Pale Heads regenerate makes it difficult to deliver a lethal blow with standard weaponry. 'If any sort of system failure were to occur within our facility, we would be woefully underprepared to defend ourselves.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-831: For this reason I would like to request that high-powered weaponry capable of subduing the Pale Heads be issued to all of our employees working in shipping and processing. This will ensure that, in the event of an emergency, we will be able to quickly eliminate the threat and evacuate safely. Thank you very much for your consideration.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-832: Shipping and Processing Manager, Gabrielle Reed.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-834: It's happened... Our worst-case scenario... The T-Virus has somehow leaked. Under orders from Dr. Bard, I'm to manufacture mass quantities of the vaccine.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-835: I've prepared a cultured the T-Virus antigen. Now I just need to combine it with an adjuvant to enhance its effects, and I should be able to produce enough vaccine to save all the surviving citizens.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-836: The adjuvant samples are stored in the incubation lab. Test subjects are already wandering the halls... But I'd better find a way to get some samples while this culture is maturing...
=====================================
ReEv3(2-837: If I don't make it back, please complete the synthesis process. Try to find a way to stop this outbreak. It's the least we can do, after setting these horrifying events in motion.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-843: Senior Fellow Dr. Frankl,
=====================================
ReEv3(2-844: Please allow me to send my heartfelt congratulations to you and your colleagues at Umbrella Europe for completing Nemesis, a truly remarkable achievement in the field of bioweapons research. Introducing a parasitic organism into a Tyrant's brain to gain external control of it? How can I not marvel at such a wild idea!
=====================================
ReEv3(2-845: However, from a medical perspective, I must emphatically state my disapproval of this shift away from established Umbrella policy. By turning to the use of parasites, you are setting a dangerous precedent.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-846: Viruses can be kept in check. I believe an effective vaccine can be developed for any virus on Earth (with abundant funding and a bounty of samples, of course).
=====================================
ReEv3(2-847: Can you say the same for parasites, however? Doctors have tried in vain to develop a vaccine for malaria. Parasites like Plasmodium are far more genetically complex than the T-Virus, and to think they will submit to control is utter folly.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-848: Perhaps, in your country, consumers are willing to buy automobiles with no brakes, but here in America, they know better.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-849: Then again, I recall you have a degree in economics, so no doubt you've already devised a brilliant marketing strategy to win over the naysayers.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-850: I look forward to your talk at the forum in Berlin next month. In the meantime, I shall be exploring medical solution to this hubristic problem you've foisted on us.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-851: Sincerely,
=====================================
ReEv3(2-858: - Always confirm that no employees are in the chamber before beginning the dissolution process.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-859: - Always use the regulated amount of solvent, regardless of the volume or mass being disposed of.
=====================================
ReEv3(2-860: - If a test subject reacts violently, do not halt the disposal process. Leave the chamber filled for at least 12 hours, then check for complete dissolution before draining.
=====================================
ReEv7-23: Dulvey, Louisiana.
=====================================
ReEv7-24: Baker farm.
=====================================
ReEv7-148: “The Unveiled Abyss”
=====================================
ReEv7-150: State authorities are asking for help locating three men who went missing during their travels to Dulvey Parish from New Orleans on the ninth of this month.
=====================================
ReEv7-151: The missing men have been identified as Peter Walken, Andre Stickland, and Clancy Javis. The three produce videos for the Internet and traveled to Dulvey to shoot footage for their latest production. Their videos consist mostly Of the group exploring abandoned buildings and haunted houses.
=====================================
ReEv7-172: You don't know him, but you get the feeling he’s an asshole.
=====================================
ReEv7-224: Captain Howell from state police told reporters they have started a search for Helen Midkiff, a college student from North Carolina who was traveling in Louisiana. Ms. Midkiff hasn't been heard of since the night of the twenty-first.
=====================================
ReEv7-225: Reports of missing persons in South Louisiana have increased dramatically in the past two years.
=====================================
ReEv7-226: The majority of those missing are tourists and vagrants. At least 20 people are thought to have gone missing so far.
=====================================
ReEv7-227: Police suspect foul play and believe there may be a connection between the incidents. Plans are in place to step up local interrogations and increase personnel to further the investigations.
=====================================
ReEv7-229: Marguerite,
=====================================
ReEv7-230: Move that piece-of-shit hippy we caught from the hall to the processing area.
=====================================
ReEv7-232: I had a lot of trouble cleaning up after the last one a few years back. I guess it's time to reinforce the windows and shore up the roof. Maybe I'll get Lucas to help.
=====================================
ReEv7-233: The water has finally receded. The house is alright, but the Old house was badly damaged.
=====================================
ReEv7-234: Lucas is making a fuss about a huge ship that’s washed up in the bayou. If that's true, I better report it to the parish. I'll go check it out tomorrow.
=====================================
ReEv7-236: Ethan, please watch this.
=====================================
ReEv7-258: The husband was a success. He's the 12th. Unfortunately, the wife was no good, so we'll just get rid of her.
=====================================
ReEv7-259: They're all rotten – Lucas is a damn idiot
=====================================
ReEv7-264: Those bastards are looking for me, but maybe this gives you a chance to escape.
=====================================
ReEv7-265: To escape, you have to find the reliefs shaped like dog heads. I saw one of the heads in the dissection room underground. Get it. It's the key out of here.
=====================================
ReEv7-266: It must be that shit they made me eat. If I'm gonna die, I'd at least like to go out fighting. I'm gonna get a hold of that shotgun I saw in the rec room and make them regret what they did to me. You need to get out of here.
=====================================
ReEv7-268: Lucas,
=====================================
ReEv7-269: I caught the guy who keeps trying to escape. I've locked him up in the leftmost incinerator, so he can’t get away again. Take him out when he's ready.
=====================================
ReEv7-274: I'm tired of chasing all these shitheads around the yard. The next time one of our guests runs away, hide the dog head reliefs, so they can't get out of the house. Let's hide them like this:
=====================================
ReEv7-275: – The dissection room in the basement
=====================================
ReEv7-278: How have you been feeling recently? It's been a long time since you came in for your last check-up.
=====================================
ReEv7-279: I'm writing to tell you that I've finished examining your X-rays. Those dark areas in your cranium are fungus-like structures that seem to be related to mold.
=====================================
ReEv7-280: The hallucinations and noises you said you've been hearing may be related to these growths.
=====================================
ReEv7-281: If your Symptoms are due to a fungal parasite, it must be removed before it's too late. I don't mean to scare you, but I am seriously concerned for your health.
=====================================
ReEv7-282: Please come to the hospital as soon as you read this letter. As your doctor, I strongly recommend you undergo further tests.
=====================================
ReEv7-283: Crawford Lang,
=====================================
ReEv7-296: My body's feeling weirder and weirder. Soon I'll become like mom and dad.
=====================================
ReEv7-297: Should I run?
=====================================
ReEv7-298: That woman she was with, Mia, she knows something. If I had the serum I could cure myself. I have to find out more.
=====================================
ReEv7-311: It looks like a plan for some sort of ﬂamethrower.
=====================================
ReEv7-313: “She's upstairs. Don't go up.”
=====================================
ReEv7-315: A painting named "Venomous Predator." It depicts a butterﬂy caught in a web.
=====================================
ReEv7-328: Zoe,
=====================================
ReEv7-329: You tried to sneak up to the second floor again, didn't you?! Did you think I wouldn't notice?!?!
=====================================
ReEv7-330: Even after what happened to Eveline, you just keep talking about some strange medicine.
=====================================
ReEv7-331: And what are you planning to do with my altar? You better keep those sticky fingers off of it!
=====================================
ReEv7-332: Nobody touches my sacred altar!
=====================================
ReEv7-333: You think your father and I are idiots?! You spoiled pathetic child...
=====================================
ReEv7-334: I wish you’d NeVEr been born. UnforGlVably pathetic yet always lookingDOWN on uS aNd trying to Leave our HOME! After EVERYthing WE'VE done for YOU... Pathetic PATHETICpathetic pathetic...
=====================================
ReEv7-335: If you EVER even touch my altar I’ll slice off your chest and serve it up as potroast...
=====================================
ReEv7-360: I'm seeing things, hearing things, can't stop feeling nauseous. I went to see tie doctor in town and he gave me an X-ray. What's happening to me?
=====================================
ReEv7-361: I put the present in the secret room right at the back of the second floor, where nobody will find it. That arm is a sign of the child's trust. That arm will lead us to happiness. And anyone who corrupts that happiness... I won't allow them to live.
=====================================
ReEv7-369: My family. (on the other side) Eveline.
=====================================
ReEv7-388: “The pig is waiting for you in the dissection room, bitch.”
=====================================
ReEv7-395: “Prove you’re a real man – stick your hand down this pig's throat!”
=====================================
ReEv7-402: “The same time as all other clocks.”
=====================================
ReEv7-407: Oliver's stopped his yelling, but sometimes I hear knocking from above.
=====================================
ReEv7-408: It REALLY stinks!
=====================================
ReEv7-409: And some weird juice is dripping from the ceiling. Anyway, since I had time, I changed the remote control trophy again.
=====================================
ReEv7-411: Mommy took me to the hospital in town. They took a photo of my head with a weird machine. Then mommy bought me a 259-piece puzzle from the toy store.
=====================================
ReEv7-412: Stupid Oliver keeps teasing me, “You're a crazyhead!”
=====================================
ReEv7-413: I lied to Oliver. I told him to come over for my birthday party, then shut him in the attic from outside by remote control. He kept crying, “Let me out, Lucas!”
=====================================
ReEv7-414: I changed the remote control so stupid Zoe can't just go into the attic.
=====================================
ReEv7-415: I melded it with one of my inventor's contest trophies.
=====================================
ReEv7-543: LNG Tanker “Annabelle”
=====================================
ReEv7-570: Director Alan Droney and Caretaker Mia Winters Recent reports suggest that if Eveline remains at her current location, she is at a high risk of being stolen by opposing organizations. Your orders, therefore, are to transfer Eveline to our Central American branch for safe keeping until further notice.
=====================================
ReEv7-571: During transfer, be sure to adhere to the following protocols:
=====================================
ReEv7-572: - Act as parental guardians for Eveline at all times to avoid suspicion.
=====================================
ReEv7-573: - Manage Eveline's vitals via the Genome Codex provided.
=====================================
ReEv7-574: - If the mission is compromised beyond reconciliation, dispose of Eveline.
=====================================
ReEv7-598: “EVIE'S UPSTAIRS”
=====================================
ReEv7-622: The contents have been taken.
=====================================
ReEv7-629: Louis,
=====================================
ReEv7-630: The cable is completely fried. We had a replacement, but we had to use it to fix something in the 3F sick bay. You're gonna have to go ask Dr. Waddell for it.
=====================================
ReEv7-631: I'm needed down in the NO. 2 Engine Room but I can't get down there unless we get this thing working.
=====================================
ReEv7-633: “16 years since the nightmare of Raccoon City, the survivors are still suffering.”
=====================================
ReEv7-635: Hey, how's it going?
=====================================
ReEv7-636: I guess half a year or so will have passed by the time you get this letter. Life is so boring here. Day after day, just the same Old sea. Although there is one thing that's different.
=====================================
ReEv7-637: This time we have some passengers sailing with us, which hardly ever happens.
=====================================
ReEv7-638: It's a couple with a little girl. I think they're distant relatives of the captain. Imagine, traveling on a tanker instead of a passenger ship. They must be hard up!
=====================================
ReEv7-639: I tried talking to the little girl earlier and her dad shot me this nasty look. What's he so worried about?
=====================================
ReEv7-640: Now that I think about it, the captain said he didn't even have any relatives...
=====================================
ReEv7-641: Maybe I'm overthinking this.
=====================================
ReEv7-642: I miss you.
=====================================
ReEv7-646: It's too late for us, but at least I can let the world know what happened here.
=====================================
ReEv7-647: I was on night shift yesterday, so I was taking a nap in the bunk room around noon.
=====================================
ReEv7-648: I was half asleep and I heard a kid, a little girl, laughing.
=====================================
ReEv7-649: Or was that all in my head?
=====================================
ReEv7-651: He looked pale in the face.
=====================================
ReEv7-652: He told me he was going down to check it out, but he never came back. It must have been around 19:50 when I heard the scream. I went to the laundry room to check and saw Clark being eaten by some sort of black-ish monster.
=====================================
ReEv7-653: The monster turned and started coming towards me, huge, shark-like teeth snapping in its jaw. I just screamed like a little girl and ran for it.
=====================================
ReEv7-654: Now I'm huddled up in the bunk room, shaking as I write this.
=====================================
ReEv7-655: There's a whole host of those creatures lurking in the passageways now. I can still hear screams now and then, but there's no way I'm going out there now.
=====================================
ReEv7-689: There was a collapse in the Patterson mine. Tuan and Beckford are dead, and Huxley will never walk on his own again.
=====================================
ReEv7-691: The company's not going to send us any replacements. They want us to work double shifts instead.
=====================================
ReEv7-703: Sent:
=====================================
ReEv7-704: Thanks to you guys it's been about a week since my head's been clear and back to normal. And she STILL thinks she's got me! You guys really need to work on fixing that. Not only does she look like a little kid, but she's about as stupid as one, too.
=====================================
ReEv7-705: Mom and dad are still totally under though. I was wondering. Is this whole "family" obsession something you guys programmed into her? It's kinda fucked up.
=====================================
ReEv7-706: Sent:
=====================================
ReEv7-707: That bitch Mia is still somewhere in between Evie-La-La Land and reality. She gets pretty violent, so I locked her up in a cell. I thought maybe Eveline would get mad since Mia's her favorite and all, but she doesn't seem to care. She actually goes and visits her sometimes. She thinks Mia's her mommy. Like I said, your "bioweapon" is fucked up.
=====================================
ReEv7-708: Sent:
=====================================
ReEv7-709: Eveline's family obsession is getting out of hand. She's making everyone kidnap more and more assholes off the street to add to her freak show of a family. Maybe she's getting tired of Mia not coming around, but it's a pain in the ass for me because I gotta clean up the mess whenever someone new comes along.
=====================================
ReEv7-710: By the way, Evie's looking sick or something. Her skin is getting all wrinkly, and she's getting gray hairs. Is that supposed to happen? It's almost like she's getting old all of a sudden.
=====================================
ReEv7-712: This report details the symptoms that appear when the bacterium* that grows inside of the E-Series infects a human. Be sure to read this document thoroughly before dealing with E-Series weaponized assets.
=====================================
ReEv7-713: +Hereafter referred to as “mold.” Initial Infection
=====================================
ReEv7-714: The mold ingests nutrients from the subject's body to propagate itself, and slowly takes over cells within the body.
=====================================
ReEv7-715: As a side effect of this, the infected subject gains remarkable regenerative abilities. During experiments, we removed arms and legs from test subjects and found that they were able to coapt the amputated limbs in a matter of minutes.
=====================================
ReEv7-716: Once the mold reaches the brain, the subject's thoughts become “in tune” with those of the E-Series asset. The subject starts to hear things and experience hallucinations, and soon comes under complete control Of the E-Series asset. If this state continues, the host will lose all sense of ego.
=====================================
ReEv7-717: After every cell in the body has been taken over by the mold, the subject begins to lose their human form. Physical mutations differ from case to case, but all result in him or her acquiring incredible physical strength.
=====================================
ReEv7-718: Containing a subject at this stage would be extremely difficult.
=====================================
ReEv7-728: Destroys cells of any subject based on the E-series bioweapon model.
=====================================
ReEv7-729: Use only for disposal of E-series assets. The toxin must first be stimulated before use. Do this by placing a sample of an E-series' cells into the necrotoxin container.
=====================================
ReEv7-732: This project was instigated in 2000 as one of several concepts for the companys NEXBAS (next-generation experimental battlefield superiority) initiative, working with technical assistance from H.C.F. to develop a bioweapon for neutralizing combatants en masse with minimal direct contact. NEXBAS was later folded, and all its assets diverted to this project. What makes this project markedly different from conventional weapons is its ability to tum enemy combatants into allies; converting hostile elements into willing servants.
=====================================
ReEv7-733: Since this effectively eliminates the costs of not only POW handling but also combat itself, it's no wonder we had the (blank) and even (blank)’s (blank) organization chomping at the bit to get on board.
=====================================
ReEv7-734: The project would never have existed were it not for the discovery in (blank) of (blank), the remarkably progressed “vicariant evolution” fungus that we commonly term the “mutamycete.” The fabrication method for each bioweapon was to introduce the mutamycete genome to a pre-Stage 4 human embryo and perform cultivation in a controlled environment over a period of 38 - 40 weeks. The resultant organisms were referred to as "candidate specimens" and graded based on usability, from the impractical and faulty.
=====================================
ReEv7-735: Series A through D, to the perfected E-Series. A common appearance was selected for the bioweapons; that of a roughly ten-year-old girl, to ensure ease of blending in with urban/refugee populations.
=====================================
ReEv7-736: The first E-Series specimen, named Eveline, has proven capable of secreting the mutamycete from her tissue at will. It is also of note that Eveline's mutamycete (blank) imposes a profound control over body and mind when introduced into a host organism. We still have a lot to learn about the mechanism by which Eveline achieves and maintains this control, but the working theory is that the vector is similar to the autoinducer pheromones used for quorum sensing in pseudomonas bacteria.
=====================================
ReEv7-737: Eveline's control is exerted in a series of discrete stages, the first of which is hallucination. Almost immediately after infection, the subject begins to see images of Eveline (though she is not in fact there) and even hear her voice (which is inaudible to anyone else). Auditions with infected subjects throughout the stages of infection reveal that at first, the phantom Eveline appears to be a normal young girl, sometimes desiring companionship Or assistance. As time progresses, she begins making more and more extreme demands, including self-mutilation and attacks on other people.
=====================================
ReEv7-738: The psychological shock this induces helps to break down the mind's natural barriers to Eveline's brainwashing effect, and by the time mental control is achieved, the mutamycete infection has progressed throughout the body's cells, so the body (blank).
=====================================
ReEv7-740: Eveline's functions also include the ability to form organisms from mycelia, the fungal filaments. The term “organism” is used loosely here; strictly speaking, they are superorganisms formed Of countless mycelia. What's important, though, is that they exhibit a strong survival instinct and will defend themselves ferociously with the slightest provocation. Their fungal toughness and remarkable strength give them significant battlefield potential. The researchers have been calling these super- organisms the “Molded”; made of mold, and also molded as in “shaped.” The name has a certain elegance to it.
=====================================
ReEv7-741: For the treatment of accidental infections, performing (blank) on samples of Eveline's body tissue produces a unique fungicidal serum. Administering the serum to an infected subject will cause the mycelia to calcify, but if the subject's cells are already largely invaded, the serum will be fatal. Since the treatment window is so small, the serum's primary use is therefore disposal of infected subjects, rather than a cure. In exploring the serum's potential, we found that subjecting it to (blank) would enhance its effects to extreme potency, becoming a compound we now call E-Necrotoxin, which (blank) in even tiny amounts.
=====================================
ReEv7-742: What's been interesting to observe in Eveline's behavior is her obsession with the concept of family. In experiments, we found on multiple occasions that infected subjects were compelled to act as her "mother" or "father," treating her as if she were really their daughter. Why did she settle upon family as the theme for her mental control? This is just speculation, but it could be that she instinctively understands that a family unit is better suited to blending into social groups than a lone girl.
=====================================
ReEv7-743: On the other hand… well, a sentimental sort might suggest that she's making up for a perceived lack of "love" in her quarantined upbringing. A parent's love.

SoVI-3: When the Evil Seed emanated from the cursed blade one fateful day in Spain, it released a white light that burst forth, affecting lands far and wide—even as far afield as Ling-Sheng Su...
=====================================
SoVI-28: — The Cave of the Master Swordsman —
=====================================
SoVI-29: When Kilik awoke, he found himself in an unfamiliar cave temple. While he was passed out, an old man had been taking care of him. Aside from identifying himself as a weapons expert from Ling-Sheng Su, the old man spoke little.
=====================================
SoVI-43: Kilik chose to fight against his fate, and as such began a period of intense training under the guidance of the old man, Edge Master.
=====================================
SoVI-62: Though the arduous training lasted three years, it seemed to pass by in the blink of an eye. The evil harbored within Kilik and Kali-Yuga was being kept at bay by Dvapara-Yuga. However, with it threatening to spill over at any moment, the only time he was able to feel anything approaching peace was during intense training.
=====================================
SoVI-77: There were several roads that led west, but the most common route was by sea. Once Kilik left the cave, he headed over the Himalayas, then traversed south in search of a port.
=====================================
SoVI-92: At a port on the eastern coast of India, the sailor he had saved brought Kilik to the ship on which he was a crew member. However, though the ship was indeed heading west, its captain, Maxi, was nowhere to be found.
=====================================
SoVI-115: The Ryukyu-born pirate captain Maxi sailed the world with his crew looking for greater adventures, which at present had led them to an Indian port. Overhearing a commotion, Maxi made his way back tb his ship expecting to find a simple altercation, but instead was greeted with the sight of an assault on his crew.
=====================================
SoVI-131: When Kilik awoke, Maxi chose not to admonish him, but instead to console the warrior as he wallowed in feelings of guilt. As Kilik and Maxi journeyed on together, they ended up becoming close friends. Then one day, a man appeared before them, blocking their way...
=====================================
SoVI-151: Kilik and Maxi headed west, eventually arriving at an oasis capital and key transport location in the Middle East, where they attempted to gather information on Soul Edge. Searching alone, Kilik stumbled upon a park where he had an unexpected encounter with a young woman from Asia.
=====================================
SoVI-172: With Xianghua now on board, the duo of Kilik and Maxi became a trio. The further west they headed, the more their target, Soul Edge, came to dominate their conversations.
=====================================
SoVI-187: As the three companions’ journey progressed, a mysterious stranger appeared before them and tried to get close to Kilik. What on earth could they be plotting?
=====================================
SoVI-222: Once in Europe, the group of travelers headed to Athens in Greece. While soaking up the ancient ambience, Kilik met a lone woman.
=====================================
SoVI-251: Kilik and the team made their way towards Ostrheinsburg, but, before they knew it, they wound up lost in a meadow. When they finally noticed their predicament, they were plunged into confusion as a strange air encompassed them…
=====================================
SoVI-276: Ostrheinsburg, what promised to be their final battleground, was within their sights. No matter what fate had in store for them, it was too late to turn back now. Steeling his nerves, Kilik made his way into the forest surrounding the abandoned castle.
=====================================
SoVI-291: The forest was littered with traps to ward off invaders. As the trio proceeded through the fallen trees. fate brought them face to face with a giant ax-wielding warrior.
=====================================
SoVI-294: Kilik:
=====================================
SoVI-309: Led by a man dressed in black, Kilik and Xianghua entered Ostrheinsburg Castle. The man walked without hesitation, as though intimately familiar with the layout and situation of the castle.
=====================================
SoVI-326: The fallen Nightmare's armor lay fractured and damaged, and fire seeped through its fissures like liquid. And yet, as long as Soul Edge remained, the mission Was far from complete.
=====================================
SoVI-338: Inferno let out a maddening scream of pain as Xianghua's final blow struck true. The fight seemed to be over but, alas, it was not. Inferno possessed unimaginable strength that made Xianghua only too aware of the tension and exhaustion weighing down her own body.
=====================================
SoVI-349: And, with that, Soul Edge was no more. The subspace began to warp and crumble away. A torrent of power burst forth from the heart of Soul Edge, threatening to consume the injured Kilik and Xianghua...

Te2-3: “It is the age of the Warring States. The old shogun has fallen and samurai fight savage battles for the right to hoist their flags over the great castles of Japan. But far from the battlefield, unseen and unheard, a different breed of warriors plied their deadly trade. Born in shadows, they will die as shadows... They are the ninja.”
=====================================
Te2-9: Grappling hook and jump training:
=====================================
Te2-10: You must master the art of moving like a ninja. Climb up the stairs and practice as I instruct you. Always be aware of your surroundings. Stop and take a look around. Head towards the marker and perform each exercise a few times before moving on. The ninja must remain unseen. You must be able to move while concealed. Roll from approached position to pop a rolling reverse from up.
=====================================
Te2-11: Now let's try jumping. Jumping makes you vulnerable so be careful. We need to go farther. Use a big jump. A ninja must use the terrain to his advantage. Practice sliding along the wall underneath the marker. Creep against the wall until you get to the corner. You will then be able to see around it. If you approach the wall that has a ledge within your reach, you can hang down an inch your way along the wall. Practice in the trench. If you come to a wall that you can't climb by jumping, use your grappling hook. The Grappling hook will only catch on edges so be careful. Try throwing your grappling hook on top of the stack of wooden. A ninja must be able to move quietly with no wasted movements. Practice stealth, it will save your life. Now begin water training first.
=====================================
Te2-12: Swimming Training:
=====================================
Te2-13: Start by using the water phantom technique. Now dive underwater and begin school. Take gently with your legs to swim slowly. Now try making a quick turn around. Try swimming a little faster. If you establish a good rhythm, it'll be able to clock. Remember to come up fir air where you will run out and you'll start drowning.
=====================================
Te2-14: Stealth Kill Training:
=====================================
Te2-15: Across the bridge and find your way into the bamboo forest to begin your weapons training. To attack an enemy, first, draw your weapon then launch your attack. Put us in one of the bamboo trees. Remember to put your weapon away when aren't using it. You can't move quickly with the nature's greatest weapon is not a sharp blade, but a sharp awareness. If you pay close attention, you can tell your enemy is feeling. Move with stealth and see if you can kill the enemies in the woods ahead with a single strike. A ninja must learn to be sensitive to the flow of tea around him.
=====================================
Te2-16: Shuriken Training:
=====================================
Te2-17: You must master the tools of the ninja. Pick up the shuriken and select them. Take a careful aim at the target and practice by throwing three shurikens. Once again, use your tools carefully. They can even be ninjas only true friends.
=====================================
Te2-47: “The senior's Lord Gohda’s death launched a vicious struggle for power, a series of battles and betrayals worse than any in Japan’s blood stained history. Now Lord Gohda left all the power and glory of his title, the riches of his empire, to his son Matsunoshin. But Lord Gohda’s brother, a man named Motohide, believed himself to be the empire’s rightful heir. Motohide was able to bribe certain samurai to his side, and immerse the empire to civil war. Gohda family advisor, Sekiya Naotada, responded the only way he could; he called to Azuma Ninja.”
=====================================
Te2-148: “Three months have passed. Gohda Castle was saved by well-timed rain shower, just as the House of Gohda was saved by the Azuma Ninja.

So if you are not very familiar with the story of Rikimaru and Ayame, or played a game a long time ago, I strongly recommend you to read it (Part 1 and Part 2). This is all the part of the philosophy of the game itself - only a true master will know the truth. <<

Te2-815: “After falling into turbulence seas, Tatsumaru was saved by Kagami, the very enemy he sought to kill. After two months of tender care at the hands of Kagami’s servants his body fully recovered… but his memory did not. And so with no recollection of his previous existence he begins a new life as one of the Lords of the Burning Dawn...”
=====================================
Te2-945: “With the completion of the floating fortress, Fire Demon, the Burning Dawn finally has the weapon it needs to conquer all of Japan.

Un3DrDe-1639: Please…
=====================================
Un3DrDe-1645: Damn it, I don’t know. I don’t know. Please, I don’t know!
=====================================
Un3DrDe-1660: and he hasn’t exactly mounted a rescue. He didn’t ’rescue’ you back in Cartagena, either. He just saw something he could exploit.
=====================================
Un3DrDe-1685: Where - is – Iram, Nathan?
=====================================
Un3DrDe-1977: He’s got to be up ahead!
=====================================
Un3DrDe-2073: Hey, Sully! No, no, no, he’s…
=====================================
Un3DrDe-2182: That’s it! Up this way!
=====================================
Un4AThEn-2: ﻿[We get into a boat, swinging in a strong storm. Behind the wheel is our main character - Nathan Drake. Next to him is a guy named Sam.]
=====================================
Un4AThEn-630: How’s things? I’ve been up to my usual shenanigans. Nothing major, but enough to keep the heat on and the wine stocked.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-631: Caught wind of something that sounded right up your alley - should you ever change your mind, give me a yell, I’m always on hand for a quick getaway.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-1889: Let it be known that I, Thomas Howard - Captain of the Dauntless - am a gullible fool.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-1891: I survived being marooned off the coast of Madagascar, I survived the attack of the East Indiaman Pembroke, but I will not survive this. My leg is broken and my crew - too cowardly to set foot in these damned caverns - cannot hear my calls for help. Who could have imagined my deeds would bring me here, to die an ignoble death so far from home?
=====================================
Un4AThEn-1892: May God Himself curse you, Henry Avery. And may my ghost haunt you the rest of your days.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-2549: Reply.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-2976: Burnes this morning as we were making preparations to leave the caves.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-2979: Now Burnes approached me, a smile on his face, urging me to consider the good of the expedition, that I not foment dissent among the crew. The threat behind his words was plain - I suggested that perhaps I needed rest and retired to my camp.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-2980: To hell with these fools. I have no intention of dying here, my only legacy words in that man’s book. If Burnes believes this place to be Libertalia - if he wishes to go on - then he and the others shall go on without me. I shall break from this group at first light. Let us see how they fare with no navigator.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-2995: To whoever finds this note, know that Jonathan Burnes, erstwhile leader and financier of our expedition, has murdered me - and others - for want of Avery’s treasure.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-2996: He worked the crew to the point of exhaustion, promising them glory but bringing them illness and starvation. He bound a man to a mast and left him to die. And then I witnessed the bastard push our navigator to his doom for daring to speak his mind.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-2997: He found me making preparations to leave for home and confronted me - I brandished my pistol and informed him I was returning to England, where I would inform the world of his deeds. And when I turned away, the blackguard shot me in the back and fled into the jungle, I returned fire, but I am not certain if the bullets hit their mark.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-2999: Signed,
=====================================
Un4AThEn-3061: You no doubt heard my vessel was destroyed by an East Indianman ship. If you grieved for me, I beg your forgiveness, but I needed the world to believe me dead.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-3062: Not only is your son alive and well, you shall be happy to hear I have resigned my Captaincy. I no longer make my fortunes as a thief, instead, my stalwart crew of buccaneers and I have joined with other like-minded souls to further the cause of Liberty.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-3063: We are founding a colony where every man is considered equal and free to do as they wish. To that end, I have chosen to work the fields and livestock - which I imagine would amuse you to no end - but it brings me satisfaction the likes of which I never found back home.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-3127: Nate:.We’ll make do. Keep heading up. How you doing back there?
=====================================
Un4AThEn-3453: Evelyn,
=====================================
Un4AThEn-3454: I was hoping I wouldn’t have to write this letter. I was hoping our last conversation made my intentions clear. I was hoping that ignoring your repeated attempts to contact me would eventually send the right message. Discovering you sent my daughter a check in the mail means the message was too subtle for someone like you.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-3455: I don’t need your money, and more to the point, I don’t want your money. I can take care of my family just fine without your help. It’s insulting to both of our intelligences to pretend that your hollow gesture would somehow “rekindle” our relationship.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-3456: What little was left of our bond died the moment you couldn’t bother to show up for Dad’s funeral. Right up to the moment he drew his last breath, he still loved you. I don’t.
=====================================
Un4AThEn-3457: I pray you find peace, with whatever it is you’ve been seeking your entire life, but do not contact me or my family again.
=====================================
UnGoAb-2: ﻿I can assure you that in the reality, Friar Marcos has not told the truth in a single thing he has said.
=====================================
UnGoAb-1016: Alright, let's hope this works.
=====================================
UnGoAb-1284: This belongs to the men who have spilled their blood for me. Now I suggest that you keep your head… senorita… Finish them!
=====================================
UnGoAb-1395: Ok, ease up. We‘re through.
=====================================
UnGoAb-1401: Not that I’m complaining mind you. I could get used to this. Heh. Give me a fishing pole and a good cigar…
=====================================
UnGoAb-1594: You alright back there?

Ya0-5631: [Majima notices a pin with a word 泰平 <i>(Taihei) on it.]</i>
=====================================
Ya0-6241: This is your last chance to move about freely before the final battle begins. Speak to Nishikiyama for a list of options. Choose “Switch to Majima” from that list to change protagonists. After switching to Majima, you will have the opportunity to return to Kiryu, so you can prepare thoroughly. Just so you know, this is a perfect time to make a new game save in case you need to come back.
=====================================

Sworn brothers since their days at Sunflower Orphanage, he stays Kiryu’s confidant, but 1995 is a dark year… In the events that follow, while Kiryu serves time in jail, Nishikiyama becomes a changed man.
