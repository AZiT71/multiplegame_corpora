Look at this... The fragments are lodged deep within your cerebral cortex. We couldn't give you an MRI - the metal, you see. But even if we were to extracted it, you would most likely suffer a brain hemorrhage. Mental and physical impairment are... unavoidable, however, you current state is not life threatening.

My theory is they wanted to get their hands on Malak to question or silence him before the Soviets could get to him. Cipher was just using us to cover things up.

The bipedal technology was developed by the Soviets... but Cipher's the one supplying it to the PFs. The question is why? What's in it for them? The answer may lie in the ""compensation"" being traded to Cipher by the PFs. Many outfits operating in Africa get locally-mined resources as spoils of war. Diamonds, nuggets of gold, and rare metals. According to the Intel Team, there's a PF convoy that regularly transports the goods. Escorted by armored vehicles, no less. Pretty heavy security for crossing the Angolan savannah. I can't imagine Cipher would be so interested in minerals alone. Those convoys have to be transporting something else.

MeGeSoVThPhPa-1031,Leader of the Child Soldiers,Somebody... help me... Help me!,Ocelot,"That'd be easy if we just knew the route or vector of the infection... From now on, if you even suspect a staff member's infected, use your iDroid to order them into quarantine. Given the situation, the men won't submit to quarantine just because I or the Medical Team tell them to. But they will listen to you. Of course, it's just a temporary measure until we find a permanent solution. But, at least, they’d be in solitary isolation so they won't infect each other, and would get the mental care they need. If we do nothing, we'll only lose more people. We have no choice. Boss, open your iDroid. I'll explain how to quarantine staff members suspected of infection. Go to the MOTHER BASE menu and select STAFF MANAGEMENT. First, take a look at the Quarantine Facility we’ve set up. We'll isolate anyone who's already symptomatic. But we have to expect that there are multiple staff who are infected, but asymptomatic. So how we identify them? At present, we have no way to tell them apart. But there has to be something for us to go on. If you notice anything, REASSIGN staff you suspect are infected to the Quarantine Facility. We'll monitor them and then contact you if there's a change in their condition. Correctly quarantining these asymptomatic infected will reduce the number of new infections. You should continue with your missions as usual. If Cipher is behind this, going after them should help us determine the root cause of this epidemic. Also, until we identify the pathogen, we can't fire or dispatch any staff. We cannot let this thing spread. Boss... get to the bottom of this, fast.

My will is different. I've known you since your time at Langley. I've long been the other side of your coin. 1964. Soviet territory. FOX's first mission. Any mess you made, I was there to clean up. You completed your task - and admirably. The “information” you returned was far more than enough to fill our pockets. With it, our futures became - more or less - set in stone. And then the major came to me with an idea. ""Washington doesn't know how to spend money,"" he said. ""I'd like to... redirect it."" His goal was an organization dedicated solely - to supporting America. Cipher. You know the rest. To him, it was mourning - the loss of his friend. Or rather, an act of revenge. On the world, but America most of all. America is a country of liberty. A meeting of immigrants. Instead of simply assimilating, its citizens live alongside others. Their roots are varied. Diverse. America's never been made up of just one people. But he tried to forge a single consciousness, For it, and from it. The idea that every citizen would use free will to unite behind their country... Unilateralism like that can't be entrusted to any one individual. So the major sought a system that used information, words, to control the “subconscious.”",,N,MeGeSoVThPhPa-1269,MeGeSoVThPhPa-1271

But I think he never understood what she wanted. Before he ever walked, or cried - even before he was born - his mother tongue was English. He doesn't know the pain of losing his own language. Not yet. He cannot understand her will. I was born in a small village. I was still a child when we were raided by soldiers. Foreign soldiers. Torn from my elders, I was made to speak their language. With each new post, my masters changed, along with the words they made me speak. Words are... peculiar. With each change, I changed too. My thoughts, personality, how I saw right and wrong... War changed me - and not only my visage. Words can kill. I was invaded by words, burrowing and breeding inside me. A philosopher once said, ""It is no nation we inhabit, but a language."" ""Make no mistake; our native tongue is our true fatherland."" My fatherland - my truth was stolen from me. And so was my past. All that's left is the future. And mine is revenge. On those who'd leech off the words of their fellow man. This is what I learned from the major. And then it hit me. It was he who should feel my wrath. He and the code he chose as basis for control. Language codes, information codes - beamed all around us - genetic codes spanning history. By controlling the codes, Cipher... Zero intends to unify the world. Codes implanted into our heads, sucking our minds dry as it spreads from one host to the next. A parasite upon this Earth. That is what Zero is. As one born into this world, he's afflicted. I hold him responsible for killing my freedom. Killing all traces of my past... Killing any promise of a future.... We are all but dead men forced to walk upon this earth. A world reduced to Zero. Cipher plans to use its codes to control the world. They think they can. And the ""mother tongue"" of all those codes is English. The Word became flesh. The final parasite. It knows English. An English strain of the vocal parasite. I will exterminate the English language. With this, I'll rid the world of infestation. All men will breathe free again - reclaim their past, present, and future. This is no ethnic cleanser. It is a ""liberator,"" to free the world from Zero. Let the world be. Sans lingua franca, the world will be torn asunder. And then it shall be free. People will suffer, of course - a phantom pain. The world will need a new common tongue. A language of nukes. My Metal Gears shall be the thread by which all countries are bound together, in equality. No words will be needed. Every man will be forced to recognize his neighbor. People will swallow their pain.

But in reality, XOF and Langley don't have a collaborative relationship, and Skull Face was not working for America. Still, I can't blame the man for being afraid. After laying low with the Mujahideen, he tried to cut his ties with the U.S. and return to the Soviet military. But along the way, someone came after him and he was forced back into hiding.
