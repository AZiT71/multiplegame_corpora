AsCrBl-2,,,,[The very first video shows us Altair with in a group of soldiers attacks the castle. After that the scene switches to a young girl talking to some Templar in the castle at the top of a high mountain.],,Y,AsCrBl-1,AsCrBl-3
AsCrBl-3,,,Maria,"Where are my ships, soldier? I was told there would be another fleet of eight.",,N,AsCrBl-2,AsCrBl-4
AsCrBl-4,,,Soldier,"I'm sorry, Maria, but this is the best we could do.",,N,AsCrBl-3,AsCrBl-5
AsCrBl-5,,,Maria,It's barely big enough to hold our cargo! How do you propose to get the rest of us to Cyprus?,,N,AsCrBl-4,AsCrBl-6
AsCrBl-6,,,Soldier,"Begging your pardon, but it might be better if you stayed in Acre.",,N,AsCrBl-5,AsCrBl-7
AsCrBl-7,,,Maria,What is that… a threat?,,N,AsCrBl-6,AsCrBl-8
AsCrBl-8,,,Soldier,"It's fair warning. Armand Bouchart is Grand Master now, and he doesn't hold you in high regard.",,N,AsCrBl-7,AsCrBl-9
AsCrBl-9,,,Maria,"Why you insolent… Very well, this ship is yours. I'll find my own way to Limassol.",,N,AsCrBl-8,AsCrBl-10
AsCrBl-10,,,Soldier,"Yes, M’Lady.",,N,AsCrBl-9,AsCrBl-11
AsCrBl-11,,,,[He leaves.],,Y,AsCrBl-10,AsCrBl-12
AsCrBl-12,,,Maria,Damn. I was a single heartbeat from knighthood. Now I'm little more than a mercenary.,,N,AsCrBl-11,AsCrBl-13
AsCrBl-13,,,,"[Suddenly, she's being attacked by Altair. He pushes her to the ground and puts a hidden blade to her throat.]",,Y,AsCrBl-12,AsCrBl-14
AsCrBl-14,,,Maria,Returned to finish me off?,,N,AsCrBl-13,AsCrBl-15
AsCrBl-15,,,Altair,Not just yet. I want information. Why are the Templars sailing for Cyprus?,,N,AsCrBl-14,AsCrBl-16
AsCrBl-16,,,Maria,"It's been a long, dirty war, Assassin. Everyone deserves a holiday.",,N,AsCrBl-15,AsCrBl-17
AsCrBl-17,,,Altair,"The more you tell me, the longer you live. So I'll ask again, why the retreat to Cyprus?",,N,AsCrBl-16,AsCrBl-18
AsCrBl-18,,,Maria,"What retreat? King Richard has brokered a truce with Saladin, and your order is leaderless, is it not? Once we recover the Apple of Eden, you'll be the one running.",,N,AsCrBl-17,AsCrBl-19
AsCrBl-19,,,Altair,I'll save my breath. The Apple of Eden is well hidden.,,N,AsCrBl-18,AsCrBl-20
AsCrBl-20,,,Maria,"Altair, consider your options carefully. The Templars would pay you a great price for that relic.",,N,AsCrBl-19,AsCrBl-21

AsCrBl-22,,,,[Maria is tied up and taken out of the castle.],,Y,AsCrBl-21,AsCrBl-23
AsCrBl-23,,,Altair,What's happening on Cyprus that would concern the Templars?,,N,AsCrBl-22,AsCrBl-24
AsCrBl-24,,,Assassin,"Civil strife perhaps. Their Emperor, Isaac Comnenus, picked a fight with King Richard many months ago… and now he rots in a Templar dungeon.",,N,AsCrBl-23,AsCrBl-25
AsCrBl-25,,,Altair,"A pity. Isaac was so easily bent, so willing to take a bribe.",,N,AsCrBl-24,AsCrBl-26
AsCrBl-26,,,Assassin,"Ah, those days are past. Now the Templars own the island, purchased from the King for a paltry sum.",,N,AsCrBl-25,AsCrBl-27
AsCrBl-27,,,Altair,"Ah! Well, that's not the kind of governance we want to encourage. Do we have any contacts there?",,N,AsCrBl-26,AsCrBl-28
AsCrBl-28,,,Assassin,I know of one in Limassol. A man named Alexander.,,N,AsCrBl-27,AsCrBl-29
AsCrBl-29,,,Altair,Send him a message. Tell him to expect me within the week.,,N,AsCrBl-28,AsCrBl-30

AsCrBl-31,,,,"[We're being moved into the future, where Altair writes down his memoirs.]",,Y,AsCrBl-30,AsCrBl-32
AsCrBl-32,,,Old Altair,"If there is good to be found in this artifact, I will discover it. But, if it is only capable of inspiring evil and despair, I hope I possess the strength to destroy it.",,N,AsCrBl-31,AsCrBl-33

AsCrBl-34,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Maria,What if I just started screaming?,,N,AsCrBl-33,AsCrBl-35
AsCrBl-35,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,People would cover their ears and carry on. They've seen an unhappy slave before.,,N,AsCrBl-34,AsCrBl-36
AsCrBl-36,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,,"[In one of the alleys, they meet a man…]",,Y,AsCrBl-35,AsCrBl-37

AsCrBl-40,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Man,Altair.,,N,AsCrBl-39,AsCrBl-41
AsCrBl-41,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,Alexander… you got my message.,,N,AsCrBl-40,AsCrBl-42
AsCrBl-42,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Alexander,I assumed it was a Templar trap. Who is the woman?,,N,AsCrBl-41,AsCrBl-43
AsCrBl-43,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,Templar bait. She was Robert De Sable's girl.,,N,AsCrBl-42,AsCrBl-44
AsCrBl-44,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Maria,"Don't belittle me, murderer. I'm a Templar too.",,N,AsCrBl-43,AsCrBl-45
AsCrBl-45,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,"Unfortunately, she's a bit of a burden.",,N,AsCrBl-44,AsCrBl-46
AsCrBl-46,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Alexander,"We can hold her for you, Altair. We have a secure safehouse.",,N,AsCrBl-45,AsCrBl-47
AsCrBl-47,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,Good. I'm going to have a look around. I'll meet you there.,,N,AsCrBl-46,AsCrBl-48
AsCrBl-48,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,,[At the safehouse…],,Y,AsCrBl-47,AsCrBl-49
AsCrBl-49,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Alexander,"Quite a ghost town, hm? People are afraid to leave their homes for fear of breaking some obscure new law. The Templars have never been interested in governing before. I wonder why now? I won't assume you're here out of charity. Can I ask your purpose?",,N,AsCrBl-48,AsCrBl-50
AsCrBl-50,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,"It's a complicated story, but can be summed up easily: the Templars have access to knowledge and weapons far more deadly than anyone could have imagined. I plan to change this. One such weapon is in OUR hands; a device with the ability to warp men's minds. If the Templars possess mare like it, I want to know.",,N,AsCrBl-49,AsCrBl-51
AsCrBl-51,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Maria,And we can certainly trust the Assassins to put the Apple of Eden to better use…,,N,AsCrBl-50,AsCrBl-52
AsCrBl-52,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,Where are the Templars holed up now?,,N,AsCrBl-51,AsCrBl-53
AsCrBl-53,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Alexander,In Limassol Castle. But they're expanding their reach.,,N,AsCrBl-52,AsCrBl-54
AsCrBl-54,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,And how do I get inside?,,N,AsCrBl-53,AsCrBl-55
AsCrBl-55,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Alexander,"Kill the captain of the castle guard. With him dead, it's likely one of our spies would be promoted to the post. And if that happens, well, you can walk right in. It's a start.",,N,AsCrBl-54,AsCrBl-56
AsCrBl-56,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,,[Altair kills the captain.],,Y,AsCrBl-55,AsCrBl-57
AsCrBl-57,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,It is done.,,N,AsCrBl-56,AsCrBl-58
AsCrBl-58,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Alexander,Good. Now find the Templar named Osman and tell him Alexander wishes his grandmother a joyous birthday. He will trust you then…,,N,AsCrBl-57,AsCrBl-59
AsCrBl-59,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,Where do I find him?,,N,AsCrBl-58,AsCrBl-60
AsCrBl-60,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Alexander,"The Cathedral square. He will be there soon. Osman thinks I'm coming to meet him, but you're the better man for this job.",,N,AsCrBl-59,AsCrBl-61
AsCrBl-61,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,,[Altair finds the man.],,Y,AsCrBl-60,AsCrBl-62
AsCrBl-62,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,"Greetings Osman. Alexander sends his regards, and wishes your grandmother a joyous birthday.",,N,AsCrBl-61,AsCrBl-63
AsCrBl-63,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Osman,"Ah, the dear lady. May she rest in peace. Now, how may I help you friend?",,N,AsCrBl-62,AsCrBl-64
AsCrBl-64,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,Can you tell me why the Templars purchased Cyprus? Was it to set up another exchequer?,,N,AsCrBl-63,AsCrBl-65
AsCrBl-65,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Osman,"I don't rank high enough to know for certain, but I have heard talk, of an Archive of some kind.",,N,AsCrBl-64,AsCrBl-66
AsCrBl-66,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,An archive? Interesting. And who is the ranking Templar in Limassol?,,N,AsCrBl-65,AsCrBl-67
AsCrBl-67,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Osman,A knight named Fredrick the Red. He trains soldiers in Limassol castle. A real brute.,,N,AsCrBl-66,AsCrBl-68
AsCrBl-68,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,"With the castle guard dead, what would it take to get me inside?",,N,AsCrBl-67,AsCrBl-69
AsCrBl-69,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Osman,"Assuming lam appointed to his position, I could find an excuse to reduce the castle watch for a short time. Will that work?",,N,AsCrBl-68,AsCrBl-70
AsCrBl-70,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,I'll make it work.,,N,AsCrBl-69,AsCrBl-71
AsCrBl-71,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,,[He returns to the safehouse.],,Y,AsCrBl-70,AsCrBl-72

AsCrBl-73,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Alexander,Excellent. Now what?,,N,AsCrBl-72,AsCrBl-74
AsCrBl-74,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,We give him some time. He also told me about the Templar Archive. Have you heard of such a thing?,,N,AsCrBl-73,AsCrBl-75
AsCrBl-75,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Maria,Of course. That's where we keep our undergarments.,,N,AsCrBl-74,AsCrBl-76
AsCrBl-76,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Altair,"Cyprus would be a good location to safeguard both knowledge and weapons. With the right strategy, it's an easy island to defend.",,N,AsCrBl-75,AsCrBl-77
AsCrBl-77,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Alexander,"Ah, if only our foolish Emperor had possessed such foresight. King Richard made short work of him…",,N,AsCrBl-76,AsCrBl-78

AsCrBl-80,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Fredrick the Red,"No mercy, men! This is an island of superstitious heathens.

AsCrBl-97,Memory Block 1. Limassol,,Armand Bouchart,De Sable was a weak-willed wretch. Verse 70 of the founding Templar Rule expressly forbids consorting with women…. for it is through women that the devil weaves his strongest web.
