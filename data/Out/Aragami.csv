Ar-15,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Aragami,Ara... gami?,,N,Ar-14,Ar-16
Ar-16,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Yamiko,"Sorry, am I going too fast? You are an aragami, a vengeful spirit summoned through an ancient ritual. I wasn’t sure it would work...",,N,Ar-15,Ar-17
Ar-17,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Aragami,...Vengeful?,,N,Ar-16,Ar-18
Ar-18,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Yamiko,"Yes. A clan called Kaiho, they... they killed my people. They took our land. They have destroyed everything. We lost the war and they razed it all.",,N,Ar-17,Ar-19
Ar-19,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Aragami,Kaiho...,,N,Ar-18,Ar-20
Ar-20,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Yamiko,"I’m one of the few who survived their attacks. They imprisoned me far away in the city’s temple. What you’re looking at now is just a projection. I don’t know how long they’ll keep me for, or if they’ll let me live... You are my only hope, Aragami.",,N,Ar-19,Ar-21
Ar-21,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Aragami,Right... What am I supposed to do?,,N,Ar-20,Ar-22

Ar-23,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,,[Aragami uses his powers to pass through the closed door.],,Y,Ar-22,Ar-24
Ar-24,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Yamiko,You can use Shadow essence? I didn’t know aragami could do that! If that’s the case then be careful in the light. It will drain your energy. Try to keep to the shadows. You can recover Shadow essence that way.,,N,Ar-23,Ar-25
Ar-25,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,,[Aragami approaches the river.],,Y,Ar-24,Ar-26
Ar-26,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Yamiko,Do you think your powers could help us here?,,N,Ar-25,Ar-27

Ar-35,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,,[Aragami quietly kills a soldier and goes on.],,Y,Ar-34,Ar-36
Ar-36,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Yamiko,Be careful. Kaiho soldiers are Light adepts. Their swords are imbued with Light essence. Don’t even think about confronting them directly.,,N,Ar-35,Ar-37
Ar-37,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,,"[Aragami kills all the soldiers and leaves the level. In the next location, he finds a small altar with a nine-tailed fox.

Ar-38,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Aragami,This again... Yamiko? I saw something. A vision.,,N,Ar-37,Ar-39
Ar-39,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Yamiko,I... I saw it too. The ritual must have created some kind of connection between us.,,N,Ar-38,Ar-40
Ar-40,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Aragami,And I had another when I woke up. Just before I met you. What does it mean?,,N,Ar-39,Ar-41
Ar-41,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Yamiko,Who knows. There aren’t many writings about the ritual I used to invoke you. Hopefully we’ll find out soon.,,N,Ar-40,Ar-42
Ar-42,Chapter I: ARAGAMI,,Aragami,…,,N,Ar-41,Ar-43

Ar-58,Chapter II: THE CALL OF THE SHADOWS,,Aragami,An animal?,,N,Ar-57,Ar-59
Ar-59,Chapter II: THE CALL OF THE SHADOWS,,Yamiko,"Yes. Apparently it has something to do with magic they used to entrap me. You have to find it, Aragami. By the way, is it okay if I call you Aragami?",,N,Ar-58,Ar-60

Ar-66,Chapter II: THE CALL OF THE SHADOWS,,Kaiho Soldier,"I don’t get why he’s worrying so much about a caged bird, that’s all. Tempted to go have a look.",,N,Ar-65,Ar-67
Ar-67,Chapter II: THE CALL OF THE SHADOWS,,Kaiho Soldier,Just... don’t. The captain will come the second you leave your post. You know it. You don’t want to see him angry.,,N,Ar-66,Ar-68
Ar-68,Chapter II: THE CALL OF THE SHADOWS,,Kaiho Soldier,Have you ever see him angry?,,N,Ar-67,Ar-69
Ar-69,Chapter II: THE CALL OF THE SHADOWS,,Kaiho Soldier,I was there when that snake Hyo gathered his men and ambushed Captain Yuki right when he was most vulnerable. When Captain Hikaru saw Captain Yuki dead... You’d understand if you saw that.,,N,Ar-68,Ar-70
Ar-70,Chapter II: THE CALL OF THE SHADOWS,,Kaiho Soldier,…,,N,Ar-69,Ar-71

Ar-75,Chapter II: THE CALL OF THE SHADOWS,,Yamiko,Huh! Good timing. I’ll try to stop it.,,N,Ar-74,Ar-76
Ar-76,Chapter II: THE CALL OF THE SHADOWS,,,"[Aragami follows the bird until he finds several watchtowers. Having climbed one of them, the hero falls under the floor, and he has another vision. We see the world with his eyes in the first person. There is a war raging around. The hero runs into an attack with an armed sword of the enemy.

Ar-81,Chapter II: THE CALL OF THE SHADOWS,,Aragami,But if I’m not seeing memories... Then what am I seeing? Whose visions are these?,,N,Ar-80,Ar-82
Ar-82,Chapter II: THE CALL OF THE SHADOWS,,Yamiko,I’m sorry. I don’t know... Maybe we can figure it out on the way to the city.,,N,Ar-81,Ar-83

Ar-107,Chapter III: CHIMES OF THE PAST,,Kaiho Soldier,If you have people waiting back home… Why didn’t you go back after the war?,,N,Ar-106,Ar-108
Ar-108,Chapter III: CHIMES OF THE PAST,,Kaiho Soldier,"When the Nisshoku empire wiped the Light brotherhoods off the map, we came back stronger. But can’t you see this peace is tenuous? One slip and the conflict could begin again. We can’t let that happen.",,N,Ar-107,Ar-109
Ar-109,Chapter III: CHIMES OF THE PAST,,Kaiho Soldier,If only we all had your determination...,,N,Ar-108,Ar-110
Ar-110,Chapter III: CHIMES OF THE PAST,,Kaiho Soldier,I wonder what all these fox statues mean.,,N,Ar-109,Ar-111
Ar-111,Chapter III: CHIMES OF THE PAST,,Kaiho Soldier,Isn’t the fox the symbol of Kyuryu’s royal family?,,N,Ar-110,Ar-112
Ar-112,Chapter III: CHIMES OF THE PAST,,Kaiho Soldier,"Maybe you’re right. That means this is the royal crypt... We could be standing on the graves of Nisshoku’s leaders, the ones responsible for the deaths of thousands!",,N,Ar-111,Ar-113
Ar-113,Chapter III: CHIMES OF THE PAST,,Kaiho Soldier,Probably. What are you thinking?,,N,Ar-112,Ar-114
Ar-114,Chapter III: CHIMES OF THE PAST,,Kaiho Soldier,I’m thinking I better pick a grave to take a dump on.,,N,Ar-113,Ar-115
