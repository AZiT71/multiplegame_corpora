ds-1,Nicole Brennan,"Isaac, it's me. I wish I could talk to you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything. I wish I could just talk to someone. It's all falling apart here. I can't believe what's happening… It's strange… such a little thing…",(on video),N,ds-0,ds-2
ds-2,,"[The video goes into static. We find ourselves on board a spaceship, on its bridge. The ship makes a hyperjump. Kendra, Zach and Isaac, the main character, are on the bridge along with a nameless pilot.]",,Y,ds-1,ds-3
ds-3,Kendra Daniels,"How many times have you watched that thing? Guess you really miss her. Don't worry, we're almost there. You'll be able to look her up once we're onboard. Sounds like you two have a lot of catching up to do.",(to Isaac),N,ds-2,ds-4
ds-4,Zach Hammond,"All right everyone, we're here. Synching our orbit now.",,N,ds-3,ds-5
ds-5,Kendra Daniels,All this trouble of that chunk of rock.,,N,ds-4,ds-6
ds-6,Zach Hammond,"Deep space mining is a lucrative business, Ms. Daniels. Aegis 7 is a gold mine, according to prospectors reports. Cobalt, Silicon, Osmium… Now where is she? There she is. We have visual contact.",,N,ds-5,ds-7
ds-7,,[They notice a large spaceship in the distance.],,Y,ds-6,ds-8
ds-8,Kendra Daniels,So that's the Ishimura? Impressive.,,N,ds-7,ds-9
ds-9,Zach Hammond,The USG Ishimura. Biggest Planetcracker in her class. And it looks like they already popped the cork.,,N,ds-8,ds-10
ds-10,Kendra Daniels,Why is it all dark? I don't see any running lights.,,N,ds-9,ds-11
ds-11,Zach Hammond,"Corporal, take us in closer and hall them. And stay clear of that debris field. We're here to fix their ship, not the other way around.",(to the pilot),N,ds-10,ds-12
ds-12,Pilot,"USG Ishimura, this is the emergency maintenance team of the USG Kellion responding to your distress call. Come in, Ishimura.",,N,ds-11,ds-13

ds-14,Zach Hammond,"Yes, we know. Who's the signal. More.",,N,ds-13,ds-15
ds-15,Kendra Daniels,"Never heard of a total communications blackout on one of these things. You'd think with a thousand people on board, someone would pick up the phone--",,N,ds-14,ds-16
ds-16,,[They hear strange demonic sounds coming from the speakers.],,Y,ds-15,ds-17
ds-17,Pilot,What is that?,,N,ds-16,ds-18
ds-18,Kendra Daniels,It's a busted array like we thought. Sounds like they're having problems with their encoder. You get us down there and Isaac and can fix it. Forty-eight hours max.,,N,ds-17,ds-19
ds-19,Zach Hammond,"All right, you hear the lady. Take us in. Let's see what needs fixing.",,N,ds-18,ds-20

ds-24,Zach Hammond,What is it?,,N,ds-23,ds-25
ds-25,Pilot,We're off track! We're going to hit the hull!,,N,ds-24,ds-26

ds-34,Kendra Daniels,What…? What the hell were you thinking? Where are you trying to get us killed?,,N,ds-33,ds-35
ds-35,Zach Hammond,"I just saved our asses, Ms. Daniels! If we had aborted at that speed and distance, we would have smashed right into the side of the Ishimura! Now settle down, and let's get to work. Corporal, report!",,N,ds-34,ds-36
ds-36,Pilot,I'm not getting any readings from the port booster and we've lost comms and autopilot. It'll take some time to fix.,,N,ds-35,ds-37
ds-37,Zach Hammond,"All right, let's get some extra hands from flight deck to help out.",,N,ds-36,ds-38
ds-38,Kendra Daniels,"Hold still, Isaac. I'm syncing up everyone's AIGs with the ship. Okay, we're done. Clean bill of health for everyone.",,N,ds-37,ds-39
ds-39,Zach Hammond,All right. We've still got a job to do. We're moving out.,,N,ds-38,ds-40
ds-40,,[Isaac walks out of the crashed ship with everyone.],,Y,ds-39,ds-41
ds-41,Kendra Daniels,You didn't lose power to the port booster. You LOST the port booster. Unbelievable.,,N,ds-40,ds-42

ds-43,,[The team proceeds in.],,Y,ds-42,ds-44
ds-44,Kendra Daniels,Seems like everyone was trying to pack in a hurry.,,N,ds-43,ds-45
ds-45,Zach Hammond,There should be a security detail in here.,,N,ds-44,ds-46
ds-46,Kendra Daniels,"Yeah, well there's not. There's nobody here. I can't pick up any broadcasts.",,N,ds-45,ds-47
ds-47,Zach Hammond,"That security console is still live. Isaac, log in and see what you can find. Kendra, get that elevator back online.",,N,ds-46,ds-48
ds-48,Kendra Daniels,Power's dead. I can't.,,N,ds-47,ds-49
ds-49,Zach Hammond,"Then re-route the damn power! Look, if we all cooperate, we can figure this out a lot sooner. Let's get that computer display up, Isaac.",,N,ds-48,ds-50
ds-50,,[Isaac goes into the next room and activates the computer with Damage Report on the holographic screen.],,Y,ds-49,ds-51
ds-51,Kendra Daniels,Huh. That doesn't look good. She's taken a lot of damage.,,N,ds-50,ds-52
ds-52,Zach Hammond,The tram system's offline. Getting around is going to be difficult. The air seems to be flowing again. That’s a start.,,N,ds-51,ds-53
ds-53,,"[Suddenly the alarm goes on. Serena howls, and the room is flooded with red lights. On the computer screen, the word Quarantine! appears.]",,Y,ds-52,ds-54
ds-54,Kendra Daniels,What the hell was that?,,N,ds-53,ds-55

ds-57,Kendra Daniels,What was that? Did you hear that?,,N,ds-56,ds-58
ds-58,Zach Hammond,I’m not sure… (part of the ceiling collapses) What the hell?!,,N,ds-57,ds-59
ds-59,Kendra Daniels,I don't know! Something’s in the room with us!,,N,ds-58,ds-60

ds-64,Kendra Daniels,Come on… come on. Got it!,,N,ds-63,ds-65
ds-65,Zach Hammond,"Isaac, get the hell out of there!",,N,ds-64,ds-66
ds-66,Kendra Daniels,"The door's unlocked, run!",,N,ds-65,ds-67

ds-68,Kendra Daniels,"Run, Isaac! Get the hell out of there!",,N,ds-67,ds-69
ds-69,,"[Isaac barely has time to get on the elevator. One of the monsters tries to pull the elevator doors apart with his sharp hands, but he is flattened. Isaac descends several floors. When he exits the elevator he finds the corpses of the Ishimura crew, a plasma cutter and sees the writing on the wall ""Cut off their limbs!"" Already in the next room, Isaac encounters a monster attacking a still alive crew member and quickly kills him with the cutter he finds. Soon Isaac finds his first audio log.]",,Y,ds-68,ds-70
ds-70,Audio Log (Engineer Benson),This is Benson. Everybody listen up! They’re using the vents! That's how they’re getting around the ship! Stay away from the vents… (someone) Look out! (Benson) Get back! Get back! (death gasps),,N,ds-69,ds-71
ds-71,,[Kendra and Zach contact Isaac on the radio.],,Y,ds-70,ds-72
ds-72,Kendra Daniels,Isaac? Isaac! God. I can't believe he made it.,,N,ds-71,ds-73
ds-73,Zach Hammond,"Isaac, we ran into more of them on the way over here. Are you okay?",,N,ds-72,ds-74
ds-74,Kendra Daniels,More what?! What the hell are those things? Is that the crew?!,,N,ds-73,ds-75
ds-75,Zach Hammond,"Keep your voice down! Whatever they are, they're not friendly. And half the doors and the ship are locked because of the quarantine. Now we have to get to the bridge, but first, we got to repair the tram system.",,N,ds-74,ds-76
ds-76,Kendra Daniels,You're crazy Hammond. You're going to get us all killed.,,N,ds-75,ds-77
ds-77,Zach Hammond,If you listen to me I WILL get you out of here alive. Now what's wrong with the tram?,,N,ds-76,ds-78
ds-78,Kendra Daniels,"The data board is fried but there should be a spare in the Maintenance Bay. There's also a broken tram blocking the tunnel that needs to be repaired. Dammit, everything is on the other side of this quarantine. We can't reach it from here.",,N,ds-77,ds-79
ds-79,Zach Hammond,"No, we can't… but you can, Isaac. If I can get to the Bridge, I should be able to access the personnel files. You fix the tram and I’ll help you find Nicole.",,N,ds-78,ds-80
ds-80,,[Isaac goes in search to find a way to fix the tram. He goes to the Cargo Hallway and on his way encounters a dead monster. He kills it by blowing off its limbs and head.],,Y,ds-79,ds-81
ds-81,Audio Log (Engineer Benson),"This is Benson. tram engineering. We think we've figured it out. Smith killed one! Listen, forget about shooting them in the body, you gotta cut off the limbs. Grab a cutter, anything like that. Cut them apart!",,N,ds-80,ds-82
ds-82,,[Isaac enters the Tram Tunnel. Zach contacts him.],,Y,ds-81,ds-83
ds-83,Zach Hammond,"Isaac, be careful. Shooting them in the body didn't seem to work. Go for the limbs, dismember them. That should do the job.",,N,ds-82,ds-84
ds-84,,[Isaac goes on and finds a stasis module next to a faulty door that quickly opens and closes.],,Y,ds-83,ds-85
ds-85,Kendra Daniels,"Looks like that door is malfunctioning, Isaac. Try using the Stasis Module you just picked up.",,N,ds-84,ds-86
ds-86,,"[Isaac slows the door down and enters Tram Station Hall. After destroying a nest of monsters, he removes the damaged tram from the pipe.]",,Y,ds-85,ds-87
ds-87,Kendra Daniels,"Isaac, you did it! That tram was blocking the whole system. When you get the computer online, you'll be able to call the tram from the control room. Faster the better… I can hear something crawling around out there…",,N,ds-86,ds-88
ds-88,Audio Log (Engineer Benson),"Listen up, car B is trashed. We managed to get it back to the repair depot, but now the auto-loader is fried. I need a Stasis module brought down here now! If we don't get this piece of shit off the tracks, it's going to jam up the whole system!",,N,ds-87,ds-89
ds-89,,"[Isaac runs to the Maintenance Bay, destroying the monsters that have appeared in the corridors. Kendra calls him.]",,Y,ds-88,ds-90
ds-90,Kendra Daniels,"Isaac. I patched into the deck’s security system. It took some work, but I've got the door to the Maintenance Bay unlocked. The data board should be somewhere inside.",,N,ds-89,ds-91
ds-91,,[Isaac enters the cargo elevator and goes down to Maintenance Bay.],,Y,ds-90,ds-92
ds-92,Kendra Daniels,Isaac. It’s Kendra. It looks like the door to the storage room is locked. There should be a key somewhere in the maintenance bay.,,N,ds-91,ds-93
ds-93,,[Isaac fights his way through the bay and finds the key. After that he goes downstairs and finds the data board.],,Y,ds-92,ds-94
ds-94,Kendra Daniels,"That's it, Isaac! Take that board back to Tram Control and siot it into the computer array. That should get the tram system back online.",,N,ds-93,ds-95
ds-95,,"[Isaac returns to the Tram Control and inserts the data board, and then starts the system.]",,Y,ds-94,ds-96
ds-96,Zach Hammond,"Alright, we're on board and heading to the Bridge. Good work.",,N,ds-95,ds-97
ds-97,Kendra Daniels,Strange… the quarantine just lifted…,,N,ds-96,ds-98
ds-98,Zach Hammond,"Whatever was in the flight lounge must have left. That's lucky for us. Isaac, get back to the Kellion and prep it for launch. We find out what we can from the bridge and meet you there.",,N,ds-97,ds-99
ds-99,Kendra Daniels,"If we live that long. You're out of your league, Hammond. This is suicide! We're going to die out here.",,N,ds-98,ds-100
ds-100,Zach Hammond,"Your lack of confidence in me duly noted, Ms. Daniels, but I have a mission to complete and that's exactly what I am going to do. With or without you. Do we understand each other?",,N,ds-99,ds-101
ds-101,Kendra Daniels,Just get us out of here alive.,,N,ds-100,ds-102
ds-102,,[Issac approaches the Flight lounge.],,Y,ds-101,ds-103
ds-103,Zach Hammond,"Isaac, we made it to the Bridge. It's a nightmare up here. No survivors. We're going to try and get to the Command computer. Wish us luck.",,N,ds-102,ds-104
ds-104,,[Isaac climbs aboard the repairs ship and tries to send a damage report. The monsters climb onto the ship and do a final damage job on it. The ship catches fire. Isaac barely manages to jump out of it before it explodes. Now he has to fight a horde of hungry monsters.],,Y,ds-103,ds-105
ds-105,Zach Hammond,What the hell is happening down there?! What happened to the shuttle?,,N,ds-104,ds-106
ds-106,Kendra Daniels,That was our ride home… It's the only way off this ship…,,N,ds-105,ds-107
ds-107,Zach Hammond,Kendra…,,N,ds-106,ds-108
ds-108,Kendra Daniels,No Hammond! This changes everything!,,N,ds-107,ds-109
ds-109,Zach Hammond,Just let me think! Can you access the Command computer?,,N,ds-108,ds-110
ds-110,Kendra Daniels,"It's no good. There’s an executive lockdown of all primary systems. Without the Captain's authorization, I can't access them.",,N,ds-109,ds-111
ds-111,Zach Hammond,Well? Where's the Captain?,,N,ds-110,ds-112
ds-112,Kendra Daniels,Here he is. Captain Benjamin Mathius. Location… Medlab. Status… Deceased.,,N,ds-111,ds-113
ds-113,Zach Hammond,What? How?,,N,ds-112,ds-114
ds-114,Kendra Daniels,"I can’t access that information. Find the Captain and you'll find his RIG. With his authorization codes, I can crack this computer wide open.",,N,ds-113,ds-115
ds-115,Zach Hammond,"Dammit! Isaac, I'm sending the tram back to your location. Get to the Medical Deck and find that RIG as fast as you can.",,N,ds-114,ds-116

ds-119,,[Isaac walks to the station and visits a vending machine where he buys an upgrade for his armor and a plasma rifle. He boards the tram. Chapter 1 completed.],,Y,ds-118,ds-120
ds-121,,[Isaac arrives on the platform of the medical deck. He sees a woman sitting next to a mutilated corpse. She is in shock. Her voice is full of tears and despair. She is blinded - her eyes are covered with bandages.],,Y,ds-120,ds-122
ds-122,Ishimura Crew Member,"Shhh… shhh… It's alright, McCoy… He’s here… Nothing to be afraid of… I knew you would come… just like you said… I… I… saved this for you… Can I go now? McCoy wants to take me… to the shuttle…",,N,ds-121,ds-123
ds-123,,[She throws the Kinesis module on the floor and dies. Isaac uses the new module to clear the blockage in the corridor and moves on.],,Y,ds-122,ds-124
ds-124,Zach Hammond,"Isaac? Are you there? We were attacked. Kendra's gone! One minute she was there, then… I can't believe I lost her. We can still do this. Get me the Captain's RIG codes and we'll find Nicole. Looks like the crew barricaded the door to the emergency wing. You'll have to blow through it to get to the morgue. Get some thermite from Medical Storage, and a shock pad from Zero-G Therapy. Should be down the corridor.",,N,ds-123,ds-125
ds-125,,[Isaac goes to the Main Laboratory. Quarantine mode is activated and he has to fight for his life. He finds an audio log in one of the offices.],,Y,ds-124,ds-126
ds-126,Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,What in god's name is going on down there?,,N,ds-125,ds-127
ds-127,Captain Benjamin Mathius,"I think that's precisely the point, doctor. God's work.",,N,ds-126,ds-128
ds-128,Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,I'm not so sure of that. We have to assume that the colony's problems are somehow connected to the Marker.,,N,ds-127,ds-129
ds-129,Captain Benjamin Mathius,"You can assume all you want to. I do not. The Maker is glorious and divine, you - you know that.",,N,ds-128,ds-130
ds-130,Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,God moves in mysterious ways…,,N,ds-129,ds-131
ds-131,Captain Benjamin Mathius,"Anyway, we'll have it on board tomorrow. You can analyze it all you want to. What are you so worried about?",,N,ds-130,ds-132
ds-132,Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,"Worried? Captain, people are dying down there. Killing each other. Is this madness the ""transformation"" Unitology teaches us?",,N,ds-131,ds-133
ds-133,Captain Benjamin Mathius,"Doctor… Terrence… there will always be risk when the stakes are high. And here, they're enormous. It could change everything.",,N,ds-132,ds-134

ds-136,Audio Log (Doctor Challus Mercer),"I finally convinced Jurgens to show me the video feed from the colony. And what I saw was glorious. Breathtaking. Miners undergoing a transformation into something extraordinary. I must know more. Even as the believer within me wants to become one of them, the scientist needs to uncover their secrets.

ds-145,Doctor Challus Mercer,So the texts were right. All this time.,,N,ds-144,ds-146

I have no doubt they are somehow linked to discovery of the marker, but the exact nature of that connection is still unknown. Almost 40 percent of the colonists are experiencing a form of dementia. The obvious symptoms are acute depression, insomnia and hallucination. Incidence of violence and even murder also indicate extreme paranoia. Dr. Mercer has advised that I bring some of the affected on board for study. Dr. Welland, the planetside psychiatrist, has reported that his aun analysis has been fruitless.
