Nicole Brennan,"Isaac, it's me. I wish I could talk to you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything. I wish I could just talk to someone. It's all falling apart here. I can't believe what's happening… It's strange… such a little thing…",
Kendra Daniels,"How many times have you watched that thing? Guess you really miss her. Don't worry, we're almost there. You'll be able to look her up once we're onboard. Sounds like you two have a lot of catching up to do.",
Zach Hammond,"All right everyone, we're here. Synching our orbit now.",
Kendra Daniels,All this trouble of that chunk of rock.,
Zach Hammond,"Deep space mining is a lucrative business, Ms. Daniels. Aegis 7 is a gold mine, according to prospectors reports. Cobalt, Silicon, Osmium… Now where is she? There she is. We have visual contact.",
Kendra Daniels,So that's the Ishimura? Impressive.,
Zach Hammond,The USG Ishimura. Biggest Planetcracker in her class. And it looks like they already popped the cork.,
Kendra Daniels,Why is it all dark? I don't see any running lights.,
Zach Hammond,"Corporal, take us in closer and hall them. And stay clear of that debris field. We're here to fix their ship, not the other way around.",
Pilot,"USG Ishimura, this is the emergency maintenance team of the USG Kellion responding to your distress call. Come in, Ishimura.",
Kendra Daniels,You're going to need to boost the signal if the power is low.,
Zach Hammond,"Yes, we know. Who's the signal. More.",
Kendra Daniels,"Never heard of a total communications blackout on one of these things. You'd think with a thousand people on board, someone would pick up the phone--",
Pilot,What is that?,
Kendra Daniels,It's a busted array like we thought. Sounds like they're having problems with their encoder. You get us down there and Isaac and can fix it. Forty-eight hours max.,
Zach Hammond,"All right, you hear the lady. Take us in. Let's see what needs fixing.",
Pilot,Gravity tethers engaged. Automatic docking procedure is go.,
Zach Hammond,What the hell…?,
Pilot,Sir! The autodock--,
Zach Hammond,What is it?,
Pilot,We're off track! We're going to hit the hull!,
Zach Hammond,"Hit the blast shields! Their guidance tether is damaged! Switch manual, NOW!",
Kendra Daniels,Inside the magnetic field? Are you insane?! About!,
Zach Hammond,"NO! We can make it inside! Corporal, I gave you an order!",
Pilot,"Argh, the field's too strong!",
Zach Hammond,Is everyone okay?,
Kendra Daniels,What…? What the hell were you thinking? Where are you trying to get us killed?,
Zach Hammond,"I just saved our asses, Ms. Daniels! If we had aborted at that speed and distance, we would have smashed right into the side of the Ishimura! Now settle down, and let's get to work. Corporal, report!",
Pilot,I'm not getting any readings from the port booster and we've lost comms and autopilot. It'll take some time to fix.,
Zach Hammond,"All right, let's get some extra hands from flight deck to help out.",
Kendra Daniels,"Hold still, Isaac. I'm syncing up everyone's AIGs with the ship. Okay, we're done. Clean bill of health for everyone.",
Zach Hammond,All right. We've still got a job to do. We're moving out.,
Kendra Daniels,You didn't lose power to the port booster. You LOST the port booster. Unbelievable.,
Zach Hammond,"Guess the power's down everywhere. Isaac, get over here and have the door pad.",
Kendra Daniels,Seems like everyone was trying to pack in a hurry.,
Zach Hammond,There should be a security detail in here.,
Kendra Daniels,"Yeah, well there's not. There's nobody here. I can't pick up any broadcasts.",
Zach Hammond,"That security console is still live. Isaac, log in and see what you can find. Kendra, get that elevator back online.",
Kendra Daniels,Power's dead. I can't.,
Zach Hammond,"Then re-route the damn power! Look, if we all cooperate, we can figure this out a lot sooner. Let's get that computer display up, Isaac.",
Kendra Daniels,Huh. That doesn't look good. She's taken a lot of damage.,
Zach Hammond,The tram system's offline. Getting around is going to be difficult. The air seems to be flowing again. That’s a start.,
Kendra Daniels,What the hell was that?,
Zach Hammond,Automatic quarantine must have tripped when the filtration system restarted. Everybody relax…,
Kendra Daniels,What was that? Did you hear that?,
Zach Hammond,I’m not sure… (part of the ceiling collapses) What the hell?!,
Kendra Daniels,I don't know! Something’s in the room with us!,
Zach Hammond,Jesus! Open fire! Open fire!,
Zach Hammond,Kendra! Power! Kendra…!,
Kendra Daniels,Come on… come on. Got it!,
Zach Hammond,"Isaac, get the hell out of there!",
Kendra Daniels,"The door's unlocked, run!",
Kendra Daniels,"Run, Isaac! Get the hell out of there!",
Audio Log (Engineer Benson),This is Benson. Everybody listen up! They’re using the vents! That's how they’re getting around the ship! Stay away from the vents… (someone) Look out! (Benson) Get back! Get back! (death gasps),
Kendra Daniels,Isaac? Isaac! God. I can't believe he made it.,
Zach Hammond,"Isaac, we ran into more of them on the way over here. Are you okay?",
Kendra Daniels,More what?! What the hell are those things? Is that the crew?!,
Zach Hammond,"Keep your voice down! Whatever they are, they're not friendly. And half the doors and the ship are locked because of the quarantine. Now we have to get to the bridge, but first, we got to repair the tram system.",
Kendra Daniels,You're crazy Hammond. You're going to get us all killed.,
Zach Hammond,If you listen to me I WILL get you out of here alive. Now what's wrong with the tram?,
Kendra Daniels,"The data board is fried but there should be a spare in the Maintenance Bay. There's also a broken tram blocking the tunnel that needs to be repaired. Dammit, everything is on the other side of this quarantine. We can't reach it from here.",
Zach Hammond,"No, we can't… but you can, Isaac. If I can get to the Bridge, I should be able to access the personnel files. You fix the tram and I’ll help you find Nicole.",
Audio Log (Engineer Benson),"This is Benson. tram engineering. We think we've figured it out. Smith killed one! Listen, forget about shooting them in the body, you gotta cut off the limbs. Grab a cutter, anything like that. Cut them apart!",
Zach Hammond,"Isaac, be careful. Shooting them in the body didn't seem to work. Go for the limbs, dismember them. That should do the job.",
Kendra Daniels,"Looks like that door is malfunctioning, Isaac. Try using the Stasis Module you just picked up.",
Kendra Daniels,"Isaac, you did it! That tram was blocking the whole system. When you get the computer online, you'll be able to call the tram from the control room. Faster the better… I can hear something crawling around out there…",
Audio Log (Engineer Benson),"Listen up, car B is trashed. We managed to get it back to the repair depot, but now the auto-loader is fried. I need a Stasis module brought down here now! If we don't get this piece of shit off the tracks, it's going to jam up the whole system!",
Kendra Daniels,"Isaac. I patched into the deck’s security system. It took some work, but I've got the door to the Maintenance Bay unlocked. The data board should be somewhere inside.",
Kendra Daniels,Isaac. It’s Kendra. It looks like the door to the storage room is locked. There should be a key somewhere in the maintenance bay.,
Kendra Daniels,"That's it, Isaac! Take that board back to Tram Control and siot it into the computer array. That should get the tram system back online.",
Zach Hammond,"Alright, we're on board and heading to the Bridge. Good work.",
Kendra Daniels,Strange… the quarantine just lifted…,
Zach Hammond,"Whatever was in the flight lounge must have left. That's lucky for us. Isaac, get back to the Kellion and prep it for launch. We find out what we can from the bridge and meet you there.",
Kendra Daniels,"If we live that long. You're out of your league, Hammond. This is suicide! We're going to die out here.",
Zach Hammond,"Your lack of confidence in me duly noted, Ms. Daniels, but I have a mission to complete and that's exactly what I am going to do. With or without you. Do we understand each other?",
Kendra Daniels,Just get us out of here alive.,
Zach Hammond,"Isaac, we made it to the Bridge. It's a nightmare up here. No survivors. We're going to try and get to the Command computer. Wish us luck.",
Zach Hammond,What the hell is happening down there?! What happened to the shuttle?,
Kendra Daniels,That was our ride home… It's the only way off this ship…,
Zach Hammond,Kendra…,
Kendra Daniels,No Hammond! This changes everything!,
Zach Hammond,Just let me think! Can you access the Command computer?,
Kendra Daniels,"It's no good. There’s an executive lockdown of all primary systems. Without the Captain's authorization, I can't access them.",
Zach Hammond,Well? Where's the Captain?,
Kendra Daniels,Here he is. Captain Benjamin Mathius. Location… Medlab. Status… Deceased.,
Zach Hammond,What? How?,
Kendra Daniels,"I can’t access that information. Find the Captain and you'll find his RIG. With his authorization codes, I can crack this computer wide open.",
Zach Hammond,"Dammit! Isaac, I'm sending the tram back to your location. Get to the Medical Deck and find that RIG as fast as you can.",
Kendra Daniels,What was that?,
Zach Hammond,"Holy shit! Come on, get out of here!",
Ishimura Crew Member,"Shhh… shhh… It's alright, McCoy… He’s here… Nothing to be afraid of… I knew you would come… just like you said… I… I… saved this for you… Can I go now? McCoy wants to take me… to the shuttle…",
Zach Hammond,"Isaac? Are you there? We were attacked. Kendra's gone! One minute she was there, then… I can't believe I lost her. We can still do this. Get me the Captain's RIG codes and we'll find Nicole. Looks like the crew barricaded the door to the emergency wing. You'll have to blow through it to get to the morgue. Get some thermite from Medical Storage, and a shock pad from Zero-G Therapy. Should be down the corridor.",
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,What in god's name is going on down there?,
Captain Benjamin Mathius,"I think that's precisely the point, doctor. God's work.",
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,I'm not so sure of that. We have to assume that the colony's problems are somehow connected to the Marker.,
Captain Benjamin Mathius,"You can assume all you want to. I do not. The Maker is glorious and divine, you - you know that.",
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,God moves in mysterious ways…,
Captain Benjamin Mathius,"Anyway, we'll have it on board tomorrow. You can analyze it all you want to. What are you so worried about?",
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,"Worried? Captain, people are dying down there. Killing each other. Is this madness the ""transformation"" Unitology teaches us?",
Captain Benjamin Mathius,"Doctor… Terrence… there will always be risk when the stakes are high. And here, they're enormous. It could change everything.",
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,That's what worries me.,
Audio Log (Doctor Challus Mercer),"I finally convinced Jurgens to show me the video feed from the colony. And what I saw was glorious. Breathtaking. Miners undergoing a transformation into something extraordinary. I must know more. Even as the believer within me wants to become one of them, the scientist needs to uncover their secrets. I need to study one of these… necromorphs, as Kyne so clinically puts it. I need to witness this infection.",
Ishimura Crew Member,C’mon! C’mon! Let me out! Nooooo…,
Zach Hammond,"Alright, that thermite you picked up should be able to melt through the barricade. Use the shack pad to ignite it. Hope I can hold this position. I can hear something big moving out there.",
Zach Hammond,"Great, you got a shock pad. Combine that with the thermite at the barricade to destroy it. Shit. I can hear more coming. Moving through the vents. Stay safe, Isaac.",
Doctor Challus Mercer,"You found something down there, didn’t you?",
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,Yes… we found something.,
Doctor Challus Mercer,So the texts were right. All this time.,
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,I wouldn't be certain of that. There was nothing divine in what I saw.,
Doctor Challus Mercer,We must embrace this! We are the First Witnesses!,
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,Mathius isn’t letting anyone down on the colony. It's under quarantine until we learn more.,
Doctor Challus Mercer,"To hell with Mathius! He, of all people, should know that this is greater than him, or the operation, or even the company. This is our deliverance!",
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,Keep your damn voice down! People are dying down there.,
Doctor Challus Mercer,"Only the worthiness and the unbelievers. But I believe. Do you believe, Terrence? Do you?",
Zach Hammond,"Okay, you're through. Should be clear from there to the morgue. Remember, the codes are on the captain's body.",
Video Log (Senior Medical Officer Nicole Brennan),"This is Senior Medical Officer Nicole Brennan, transmitting ship wide. We need more help! We don't have the resources to deal with this many cases. Nobody will tell us what's happening. These wounds… we're not equipped to deal with this… (screams in the background) God. Get him to the table! Hold him! Nurse, you hold him down! Christ! End recording!",
Zach Hammond,"That was Nicole, right? I can't tell from here when that log was made.. I'm sure she's around here somewhere.",
Audio Log (Eileen Fisk),"Hello? Can anybody hear me? My name is Eileen Fisk. I just woke up in here and everybody was gone… I don't know what's happening… Why did they all leave? I'm going to try and find someone… If you can hear this, please come for me… I can hear scratching in the walls… H-Hello? Who's there? Are you a doctor? Why has everyone… wait. I know you. You're Harris! The prisoner from the colony! You killed that nurse… Help! Somebody help me! Please!",
Audio Log (Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne),"Science log. Chief Science Officer Dr. Kyne reporting. The colony's problems concern me greatly. I have no doubt they are somehow linked to discovery of the marker, but the exact nature of that connection is still unknown. Almost 40 percent of the colonists are experiencing a form of dementia. The obvious symptoms are acute depression, insomnia and hallucination. Incidence of violence and even murder also indicate extreme paranoia. Dr. Mercer has advised that I bring some of the affected on board for study. Dr. Welland, the planetside psychiatrist, has reported that his aun analysis has been fruitless. I'm hesitant to rely on Dr. Mercer at this point, but I need his expertise. We need solutions and we need them quickly.",
Zach Hammond,"Codes received, and they look good. Thank god. I’ll start accessing the Captain's records right now. Head to the tram station, and contact you there. I'm going to find out what the hell happened to this ship…",
Zach Hammond,"Isaac! Somehow one of them found a way down to the Captain's Nest! I managed to contain it in a damaged escape pod. Lifting the executive lockdown now… I found the deck logs… Whatever is happening around here, it came from the planet when they cracked it open. It spread to the colony, and reached the ship. Isaac, this isn't an infection. It's some form of alien life! Shit! We've got bigger problems. The ship's engines are offline and our orbit is decaying! Get over to the Engineering deck asap, while I stay here and figure out what the problem is.",
Zach Hammond,"Isaac, we've got two problems, and we're working on borrowed time here! First, there's no fuel in the engines. Second, the gravity centrifuge is offline… which means there's a couple of trillion tons of rock pulling us down. I need you to get that centrifuge operational. Refuel the main engine and fire it up so I can stabilize the ship's orbit.",
Audio Log (Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple),"Personal log, acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple. It's been two days since they pulled that planet open… since the captain died. The panic, the riots… they were nothing compared with what came after. Our friends, our co-workers, started coming back… Changed… coming back to kill us, drag us away. Rucker disappeared this morning, and I have to assume he's dead. My crew… they're starting to crack. I'm trying to keep an eye on them, but right now I have bigger problems - we're hemorrhaging fuel and the primary engine is laboring. Danvers and I are going to try to reach the fuel depot to see if we can fix it. Temple out.",
Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple,What in hell is going on here? Danvers!,
Danvers,It's… it's Henderson. He's crazy! Pulling his own… teeth out!,
Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple,Henderson! For god's sake!,
Henderson,Unh…,
Danvers,"Oh, god. Is he dead?",
Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple,"Relax, he's alive. But he hit that door pretty hard.",
Danvers,Man… Why would he do something like that? I don't get it.,
Danvers,Never should have let him live. Never should have let him live.,
Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple,"Shut it, Danvers! Shut… it! Engineering log. Temple reporting. Someone has shut off the fuel lines to the primary engine and damaged the valves in the process. They need to be repaired before I can re-open them, but we're running out of time. With the engine offline, orbit decay will begin in less than ten hours. I just can't understand who would do this. If it's one of those crazy Unitologist bastards, I’ll break their neck.",
Danvers,Henderson said they were coming. We never should have let him live.,
Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple,Shut up Danvers and help me with the tools. Temple out.,
Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple,"This is Temple. Now the centrifuge is offline! We've got four trillion tons of rock hanging off our ass, and without that centrifuge to balance the ship, the gravity tethers will puil us straight down to the colony! I’m heading in there now to see if I can fix it.",
Computer,Decontamination sequence activated. Please stand by.,
Computer,Decontamination complete. Thank you for your patience.,
Computer,"Centrifuge power offline. Please attach generator modules manually, then return to this station.",
Computer,Generator module attached. Generator module attached. Centrifuge power restored. Centrifuge activated. Re-establishing balance with planetary cargo. Gravity restarted. Entering vacuum.,
Zach Hammond,"You're doing great, Isaac! Centrifuge and gyros are both a hundred percent and stabilized. Now get out of there and focus on the engine. I don't know how much time we have left.",
Kendra Daniels,Isaac! Can you hear me? It's Kendra… They attacked me… I ran for it… and Hammand iust… he just disappeared.,
Zach Hammond,Kendra! Where are you?,
Kendra Daniels,"Nice to see you're alive and well, Hammond. I’ve barricaded myself in the computer core. I can hear them moving outside. But I don't think they know I'm in here-- I can log into everything from here. I hacked the root, and found some reports from the colony. Even before they cracked the planet, the colonists were experiencing widespread dementia. It seems to be related to some artifact they found on the planet. Something called “the Marker.” I’ll keep looking. I've got your location, and I'm going to unlock the door to Fuel Storage. You can get to the engine chamber from there.",
Audio Log (Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple),"This is Temple. Screw the engine. I can't restart it by myself, and with all the other shit going on, it's obvious this is sabotage. I'm heading for the bridge. and then I need to find Elizabeth. I've got to get her off this ship. It's not safe.",
Computer,Ignition sequence initiated. Please stand by.,
Computer,Engines firing.,
Zach Hammond,"It's working! We're online and functional! Finally some good news. Get a tram to the bridge. Isaac, I'm going to take us back into a geostationary orbit.",
Kendra Daniels,"Wait, wait! We're not safe yet. The ship's asteroid defense system is offline. On the way up, the ship's going to pass through a debris field thrown up from the planetcrack… We’ll be ripped to pieces unless you restart it.",
Zach Hammond,"Goddammit. I’ll start working on it from here. Isaac, meet me at the Bridge. You can do more good here than I can.",
Nicole Brennan?,Isaac… Isaac… Where are you… It's me… Nicole…,
Zach Hammond,"Isaac, come in. Kendra's right, the ADS is completely shot. I'll need your help to fix this. Kendra, if you can hear me, see if you can get into the ship reports. It sounds like you have better access from there.",
Kendra Daniels,"When were you going to tell us about the artifact, Hammond? This ‘Marker?’",
Zach Hammond,I don't know anything about that. It's referenced in the captain's records. They brought it up from the planet…,
Kendra Daniels,It’s on the ship?!,
Zach Hammond,In cargo. They think it's alien origin. But I don't know what the hell it is.,
Kendra Daniels,Really? CEC didn't know anything about it? You’re lying.,
Zach Hammond,Back off. I am not the bad guy here. We're all shaky right now. You're going to have to trust that I don't know anything about it. (static) We’ve entered the debris field! Get to the captain's nest. I'll explain everything later. Hammond out.,
Computer,Warning! Hull breach detected.,
Kendra Daniels,"Isaac! Impact on the bridge, right at your feet! I'm reading heavy damage, but containment looks solid. Life support is stabilized. We've got to get the ADS working.",
Audio Log (Unknown Crew Member),"Bridge, come in! We’ve been boarded! Repeat, the ship has been boarded! We are under attack! What the hell are they? They, they've already killed most of the Deck staff! We need security backup here immediately! Guns are useless, we can't hold them back for very long…",
Zach Hammond,"Isaac! Damn, you scared me. This place is making me jumpy. Fucking asteroids coming through the roof… Look. I know Kendra doesn't trust me, but I don't know anything about a Marker or anything else. This was supposed to be a repair mission, plain and simple. This mess is the Asteroid Defense System. I can fix these boards, but the main power routing is shot. You're going to have to re-route them manually through at least three junction boxes to activate the primary cannon. Oh, but first you need to activate the Atrium elevators from Bridge Security. You can use them to get to the junction boxes. By the way, Isaac. Be careful. I saw something out there, I don’t know what. I only got a glimpse, but it was big. Really big.",
Zach Hammond,Shit! Stand back! (flushes the pod) Thought that one was dead when I sealed the pod. These things don't die easily.,
Zach Hammond,"Your weapons can't punch through that thing's armor! Shoot it in the back, Isaac!",
Nicole Brennan?,Isaac… Make us whole again…,
Captain Benjamin Mathius,"This is mutiny! You'll all be tried for mutiny! Kyne, make them listen to reason!",
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,"Settle down, Ben. Hold him! By maritime law article 5459 I hereby declare Captain Benjamin Mathius unfit for duty.",
Captain Benjamin Mathius,"The Marker must be delivered to the church! Terrance, please…",
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,"I’m sorry, Ben, but I can't let you do this.",
Captain Benjamin Mathius,Traitor! Heretic!,
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,Hold his head!,
Captain Benjamin Mathius,Murderer!,
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,Hold him!,
Captain Benjamin Mathius,Aaarrrggghhh!,
Ishimura Crew Member 1,He's… he's dead…,
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,No! It was an accident! I had to stop him…,
Ishimura Crew Member 2,Arrest the Doctor!,
Kendra Daniels,It looks like some of the gravity platforms is malfunctioning. Keep an eye out for any kind of distortion effect coming from the floor. It could be dangerous.,
Zach Hammond,Ship Systems junction box re-routed. I’m making some progress with the tracking grid… one of the cannons is giving me a hard time… keep moving.,
Kendra Daniels,"Isaac, listen up. I've gone over the med-sci reports. These things are BIO-RECOMBINATORS. They take dead tissue, absorb it and molds it into new forms. One iteration seems to have the sole purpose of infecting corpses. The others, well, seem to be making corpses to infect. And that body tissue we keep seeing on the walls is part of it, too. I found a report that says it's a habitat changer.",
Computer,Power transferred to the ADS.,
Zach Hammond,Control Systems junction box re-routed. I'm getting a reading! Almost there.,
Ishimura Crew Member,Make us whole again.,
Audio Log (Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple),This is Temple. The bridge is fucked. I don't know what went on in there. but I'm not sticking around in case whatever did it comes back. I'm heading for Hydroponics. to find Elizabeth.,
Computer,Asteroid Defense System now online.,
Zach Hammond,"All right, we've got enough power. But the ADS cannon's auto targeting is down. I think it's a faulty data cable. I need you to aim the cannon manually until I can replace it. Take the elevator to the top of the ship, and head for the cannon pit.",
Zach Hammond,"Isaac, you're going to have to cross the ship exterior to reach the ADS cannon. Problem is, we're still getting bombarded by asteroids. Look for cover or you'll get torn to pieces.",
Computer,Warning. Multiple impacts detected across the starboard hull.,
Computer,Manual override initiated.,
Zach Hammond,"That's it, Isaac, you're in the pit. The cannon's a massdriver, so it should punch through anything flying at us. Keep an eye on the hull's integrity. Too many of those things get by and we're dead. I think I’ve almost got the system repaired. Just buy me a little more time!",
Zach Hammond,I've almost got this thing fixed! Just a little bit longer!,
Computer,Automated tracking system enabled.,
Zach Hammond,"Nice shooting, Isaac! Auto targeting is now online and cleaning a path to safe orbit! As soon as we're clear, I engage the autopilot again. Head to the tram station and I meet you there when I'm done.",
Kendra Daniels,"Wait! Isaac, Hammond… you're not gonna believe this. Oxygen levels are falling. Something's poisoning Hydroponics air production, and whatever it is, it's filing the deck up with that organic stuff. We're not going to have any air to breathe soon. But if I understand these lab reports correctly, I think I can make a poison to destroy it. Head to Medical. It should have everything you need.",
Zach Hammond,"Will this never end?! Isaac, get to Medical and mix together whatever Kendra's come up with. I'm heading to Hydroponics. If I can slow it down, that might keep us breathing long enough to fight it.",
Kendra Daniels,"Shit, Isaac! I can smell the contaminated air from here. It's spreading faster than I expected! I'm trying to isolate it but it's not going to buy us much time! We have to get that thing off this ship! The chemicals you need are in the Chemistry Lab. I’ll hack the door for you when you get there.",
Creepy Voice (Doctor Challus Mercer?),"You can't stand in the way of God's plan… The natural order… Are you… Are you blind, like the rest?",
Kendra Daniels,"Looks like someone has reprogrammed the door locks on this deck. And recently, too. I guess we're not alone here. after all. Someone doesn't want you in this part of the ship.",
Kendra Daniels,"You're close to the chemistry station. Once you get the chemicals, you're also going to need a DNA sample of the alien tissue. I’ll search the records for one.",

Kendra Daniels,"Let's hope that poison works! Head back to the tram station, and get up to Hydroponics as fast as you can. Still no response from Hammond so be careful! There's no telling how contaminated that deck is.",
Doctor Challus Mercer,"I’m beginning to truly admire your spirit, misplaced as it may be! I think... I think you should see... The whole plan. You should not spurn the Hive Mind's offerings. You deserve to witness that, at least.",
Doctor Challus Mercer,"Perhaps now you will understand. The work I have done must continue… will continue! I, Dr. Chailus Mercer, shall serve as the catalyst to the salvation of our species! These specimens will return to Earth with me. I will spread their divine glory across the entire planet! I’11 leave you with my creation. Embrace the inevitable.",
Computer,Freezing cycle activated. Freezing cycle successful. Transporting patient.,
Kendra Daniels,Let's just hope that's the last we see of that… thing. I’ve managed to override Mercer's lockdown. There's a secondary tram station nearby and you can take to Hydroponics. Let's just hope there's enough time.,
Audio Log (Doctor Elizabeth Cross),"Hydroponics Log. Dr. Elizabeth Cross reporting. I'm pleased to say that we're working close to maximum capacity at the present time. All flora is healthy and thriving and food yield has created a surplus. I was going to pass the surplus on to the colony, but the Captain has given a no-fly order. I want to note my opposition to that order. Everyone knows they're in trouble down there, and I don't see what denying them our surplus will achieve.",
Computer,Watering cycle initiated.,
Zach Hammond,"Isaac.. Good to see you in one piece... Don't take... your helmet off... The air’s rotten... I got a look.. at it.. It's huge... you won't believe it.. shut itself in Food Storage.. The crew that was on this deck... I think they're what's poisoning the air. They've been transformed... I saw one of them, bloated, swollen. They're poison factories… we need to take them out while we can still breathe...",
Kendra Daniels,"Hammond! I thought you were dead! You need to get to cleaner air! You're not going to be able to help Isaac in your condition. Isaac, I’m scanning the area now. He's right, there's something really big in Food Storage, but I can't get a good scan. Monitor readings are off the scale. Be careful!",
Kendra Daniels,"That's the door to Food Storage. But I can't override the integrity lockdown. You have to destroy the pods to bring the air quality up. Then you can go through and use the poison on the Leviathan. I suppose I should be glad that Hammond's alive, but I still don’t trust him. I think he's hiding something about the Marker.",
Computer,Warning. Air filtration system is still active. Entering the filtration tubes is extremely hazardous.,
Audio Log (Doctor Elizabeth Cross),"Hello? Hello! Security! Thank god. This is Dr. Cross, in Hydroponics. I'm trying to locate Second Engineer Jacob Temple! I can't get through to Engineering! Of course I know there's a ship-wide medical alert! That's why I'm trying to locate him! No, we're safe for now. But the tram is down, and we can't reach the escape pods. Hello? Hello?!",
Audio Log (Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple),"This is Temple, Acting Chief Engineer. I came down here to find Dr Elizabeth Cross, but she's not here. In fact I can't find anyone. Just more of this organic shit everywhere. I'm going to check the Mining deck. It's about the only place I haven't locked yet.",
Kendra Daniels,"That's the last one, Isaac. There’s a switch in Atmosphere Control to restart the oxygen recycling. Once the air's clean, you can get into Food Storage. Isaac, I've been reading these reports… the crew all began having mass hallucinations. And… well... just saw my brother on a security monitor. And that's just not possible…",
Nicole Brennan?,Isaac… Where are you? Help me…,

Audio Log (Doctor Elizabeth Cross),"Hydroponics log. This is Dr. Cross. It... It's hard for me to believe what I'm seeing here. This is crazy, absolutely crazy. I'm going to the Mining deck. I hear that's where survivors are gathering. Jacob… I'll wait for you there.",
Computer,Unknown antigen injected into the filtration system.,
Kendra Daniels,"Dammit the poison wasn't strong enough. It's still alive! Get in there and kill it, before it contaminates the entire ship!",
Kendra Daniels,"Isaac, you did it! Hammond? Do you read? Oxygen levels are returning to normal. Dammit! He's gone again! No sign of his RIG anywhere! It's up to us now. I've got a plan to get off this ship! I’ve located an SOS beacon on the Mining Deck. If you can get down there and activate it, we might be able to send a distress call.",
Kendra Daniels,"This may be our last chance of getting out of here alive, Isaac. There's an asteroid loaded up in the mining bay, waiting to be smelted. If you attach the SOS beacon to it, you can launch it away from the ship to make a clean broadcast. The beacon's on the Maintenance sub deck. You can launch the asteroid from the control room. Damn, the control room is locked. It looks like they keep an emergency access key on the Processing sub deck. Couldn't be easy, could it? I don’t know how much more of this I can take.",
Kendra Daniels,"The mining sub deck is offline for some reason, Isaac. I'll see if I can run a bypass.",
Audio Log (Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple),"This is Temple. I found Elizabeth, but there isn't a single spaceworthy vessel in the whole goddamn bay!",
Doctor Elizabeth Cross,"Jacob, hurry up! We need to find a beacon!",
Acting Chief Engineer Jacob Temple,There's got to be one around here somewhere.,
Kendra Daniels,There's a failsafe on the processing control door. It won’t open until gravity is restored. But you can't turn on the gravity until those boulders are cleared from the room. Maybe you can dump them into that gravity beam with your Kinesis gun.,
Computer,Anomaly destroyed. All free-floating anomalies destroyed. Gravity can now be restored. Gravity restored. Access permitted to control room.,
Kendra Daniels,"That's the key, Isaac. It'll get you into the Control Room so you can launch the asteroid. Don't forget to attach the beacon first! I read another report on the colonist's dementia. It seemed to start after they removed the Marker from the planet. God knows how long it was down there.",
Computer,Please recycle any unused materials regularly. Thank you.,
Audio Log (Crew Member),Dr. Kyne! What the hell are you... Aaah!,
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,Get back! Come any closer and... and I'll shoot him! Give me the access codes to the cargo bay!,
Crew Member,You... idiot! This is… processing! Why the hell... would I have codes… to cargo?,
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,Don't lie to me! I'm sick of everyone lying to me! It is imperative that I get the marker! Give me those codes!,
Crew Member,I don't... have them! Is this... what you did… to the captain? Go and... shoot me if you’ve got... the balls!,
Chief Science Officer Terrence Kyne,IDIOTS! It’s the only way to stop it... The only way to end this!,
Crew Member,He's completely lost it... Somebody call security!,
Nicole Brennan?,"Isaac! Is that really you? It feels like it's been so long... But I can help you, now. Come with me.",
Nicole Brennan?,The Beacon's in the storage room next to you. I think I can disable the lock from here. Hold on!,
Nicole Brennan?,"Okay, the door's unlocked, Isaac. I can't get over to you… but I'll find a way. I love you... this will all be over soon...",
Kendra Daniels,"Isaac! Hey, I lost your signal for a while. You had me worried... I see you've got the beacon, so head for the mining bay and attach it to the asteroid. I've been running trajectory calculations and if we launch soon, there's a good chance the asteroid can reach a safe distance to begin transmitting. Still no sign of Hammond. In his state, I can imagine he's still alive…",
Computer,Safety gear must be worn at all times in Class A environments.,
Kendra Daniels,"I've got elevator access to the mining sub deck. It was a security lockdown, although I don't think it helped them. Now that you've got the beacon and the key, head over there. It looks like the asteroid is held in place by some gravity tethers. You'll have to knock those out before you can launch it.",

I thought I saw my brother again. He waved to me. Like nothing was wrong. Okay, I should be able to leave this channel open... What? The Comms Array receiver isn't responding! Isaac, can you get back to the bridge? We need that array online or we can't receive signals from anyone responding to the beacon!",
Kendra Daniels,"Things are looking up! A military ship lust shocked in the USM Valor... I don't know what it was doing out there, but it must have gotten our distress signal. We can't talk to it until that Comms Array is fixed. I'm going to hack the door to Communications for you. Get in there and find the Comms Control Station.",
Kendra Daniels,"Isaac, the door to Communications is open. But I've been getting some weird feedback spikes on the local comms. I think someone's listening in on us so be careful.",
Audio Log (First Comms Operator Bailey),"Communications log. First Comms Operator Bailey reporting. The ship is under attack, but requests to issue a distress call have been repeatedly denied by Captain Mathius. He won't say it, but everyone on the bridge knows why--this is an illegal operation in a prohibited system. We've all known for months, and we kept our mouths shut. Not any more. Mayday, mayday, mayday! This is USG Ishimura, this is--what the hell? I don't believe this! The whole comms system is offline! Now he's gone too far... Balley out.",
Computer,Communications array online. A service technician has been notified.,
Kendra Daniels,That Comms Array is in bad shape. We need at least six working dishes for a strong enough signal. Make sure they're aligned symmetrically so there are no power gaps.,

Computer,Error: blast door blockage detected. Please contact a repair technician.,
Kendra Daniels,"Shit! Isaac, there’s something big on the hull of the ship directly above the Comms Array. Something organic. I don't know what it is, and I don't care.

Kendra Daniels,Why did they open the pod?! Dammit...,
Kendra Daniels,"Oh my god, It's heading right for us! Isaac! ISAAC! Get the fuck out of there! It's going to crash into the ship.",
Nicole Brennan?,"I wish I could just talk to someone. It's all falling apart here. (the picture changes to coughing Zach) Isaac! Isaac, are you there? Thank god you're all right! I've been trying to reach you! Someone's been blocking my RIG signal remotely! That crash must have interrupted the signal block.",
Kendra Daniels,Hammond? Where have you been?,
Zach Hammond,"Surviving. Barely. I found some med supplies and patched myself up. Listen. I'm calling abort on the mission. Fuck the CEC and fuck the chain of command. We have to get the hell out of here! I think I've located a shuttle on the crew deck. The flight log says it needs a new singularity core, but we can probably salvage one from the Valor. I can see the tail-end of it sticking out from the side of the Ishimura. I'm headed down there now to find a way inside! I'll meet you there! Hammond out.",
Kendra Daniels,"Isaac. If what he says is true about the shuttle, we might have a chance of getting out of here. Head to the cargo bay and see if you can help Hammond... in his condition, he may not last long.",
Zach Hammond,"Isaac? Good. You made it inside! Listen, I just found the munitions log for the Valor! I don't think their presence here is a coincidence. They're not on reconnaissance and they're not on patrol! This ship is prepped for war! They're on a seek and destroy mission. Do you hear me?! (static)",
Kendra Daniels,"Isaac, I've lost him again! No signal from Hammond's RIG... Find the singularity core and get the hell out of there!",
Kendra Daniels,"Isaac, one of the Valor's weapons dipped open in the crash. Those green orbs you see are highly radioactive, and the Valor's airlock has sealed itself. You're going to have to throw those into space before you can get into the ship.",
Computer,Radioactive material removed. Radiation hazard clear. Safety lock released.,
Kendra Daniels,"The part you're looking for will be in the engine room at the back of the ship! I'm reading massive damage, so you may need to find an alternate route to get there.",
Zach Hammond,The infection process is doing something strange to these soldiers. They all had built-in Stasis units in their body armor. The infection is merging the Suits unit into their flesh or something... making them move fast… real fast. Be careful.,
Nicole Brennan?,Isaac... Make us whole again…,
Zach Hammond,Isaac. I'm tracking your position but it doesn't look like I can reach you. This damn ship was nearly sheared in half. I made it to the bridge… It's a mess here. These poor bastards didn't stand a chance. I'm going to override all door locks so you can get to the engine room. I'll try and catch up with you there.,
Terrance Kyne,"Mr. Clarke! I need to speak with you... My name is Terrance Kyne... Doctor Kyne. Listen to me, there isn't much time... If you really can repair the shuttle... there is a better use for it than just running away. You must understand, the forces at work here are... greater than you can imagine.

There's three of them scattered around the deck. I'm downloading their locations. I can't access the doors from here, so you'll need a Crew Key. If you can find those parts, I think we can get that shuttle operational again!",
Terrance Kyne,"Amelia? No… No no NO NO! The shuttle is mine. I control access to the shuttle! If it could make the journey... I could fix everything... I'm sorry, Mr. Clarke. Unless you can prove to me you can get space worthy again. I'm afraid I can't let you through. I need to know you're on my side!",

Challus Mercer,"How can you be turning away from the Church in this vital hour? Do not abandon your faith! What's happening on the colony is not a tragedy. It is God's work! The truth is even more fantastic! On the planet below us, we have found a Marker! Can't you see, God's plan is unfolding, and we are its inheritors! We will ascend, as we always knew we would! UNITOLOGY IS TRUTH! And your death is the first phase of this transformation. Do not be deterred by the physical methods of transformation. Soon, you will be beyond any physical concerns! You must have faith in the process. Where are you going? You fools! This is what we ve been searching for all these years! This is what we have been waiting for. Don't listen to them! Come back! COME BACK!!!",

Terrence Kyne,Excellent work. Mr. Clarke! Excellent work. Now... come and meet me in the Executive area. The door is unlocked. Be quick.,
Kendra Kyne,"Isaac, be careful with Dr. Kyne. A lot of what I've discovered so far has come from his records... the man has clearly gone insane. He might be unstable, maybe even violent.",
Terrence Kyne,"Amelia. I knew that you would know what to do. I knew, I love you so... You made it! Thank god, you made it... I've been following your progress. I know you want to repair the Executive shuttle and leave this place, but... Escape is impossible at this point. The... the shuttle's shockpoint drive is destroyed. No no no no no no no, don't lose hope! Don't lose hope. At first I lost hope. I tried to scuttle the ship, sabotage the systems... but Amelia... she changed things. The church! They think the Marker is divine, but they don't know what's happened here! What's been released! Look, look, look... Look at this.",
Terrence Kyne,"That is what we found in the core of the planet... Mercer calls it the Hive Mind. It's the source… controlling the necromorphs telepathically! We were so STUPID! But Amelia, she knew. She knew it could be stopped... by returning the Marker to the planet! The Marker was containing it within the planet. Return the Marker, and seal the Hive Mind! Please. I'm sorry Amelia... I bear much of the responsibility for this tragedy. Now, I must take responsibility for ending it, and atone for my sins. But you can help me. If you repair the shuttle, and bring the Marker back on board... We can end this. Forever.",
Audiolog (Captain Benjamin Mathius),"Captain's log, personal. I want to set the record straight. By the time this log is heard, my actions will have been vindicated. I'm a Unitologist. By now, it's probably no secret that we shouldn't be in this star system. Just another illegal mining job for the company... That is until the colony found the Marker. That was when the Church took an interest, and chose me to lead this pilgrimage. They also ensured many of the mission crew were devout. My primary instruction was to get the Marker up from the colony and on board the ship. Dr. Kyne, the CSO. is an expert on the original Marker and was tasked with deciphering this new one. He Says he's making good progress. My decision to quarantine the colony is sound. They've got some kind of epidemic down there, and I can't allow it to infect the ship. Not with such a precious cargo. Not when we are so close! Planetcrack takes place tomorrow. We'll continue to decipher the Marker, and when we return home, we'll pass all our findings, and the Marker to the Church. The government isn't going to cover this one up. Altman be praised.",

Terrence Kyne,Wait... Amelia... where are you going... wait. (dies),
Kendra Daniels,"Sorry Isaac. I couldn't let him go through with it. I suppose I should thank him for finding the Marker. We even managed without help from the USM Valor... Thank you for helping me find it, by the way. My departments been looking for this place for a long time. See, what Kyne didn't know was, it was the government's mess to begin with. This whole planet is one big experiment. The Marker? This divine relic? (chuckles) Made by man. They reverse-engineered it a couple of hundred years ago from the REAL Marker, a true alien artifact recovered on Earth. They dug it up, studied it, and made it their own. Then they brought it to Regis 7, and activated it. And you've seen the result. The stuff of nightmares. They sealed the system, and no one would have been the wiser. But then CEC blunders in and starts tearing the planet apart. The experiment was still alive. Kyne was right about the Hive Mind. The Marker would contain it… but that doesn't matter now does it? I have the Marker and this entire system can go to hell. For what it's worth, you did a great job, Isaac. See you around... Or maybe not.",
