MiShofMo-2,,,Galadriel,"It was here, on the slopes of Mt. Doom, that the dark lord Sauron was defeated by a last alliance of Men and Elves… It is here for two and a half thousand years the Rangers of Gondor stood watch, guarding against a nameless threat they had all but forgotten. And while the strength of Gondor faded, the power and malice of Sauron grew in darkness. He has returned to Mordor. Shadow and flame have fallen on the Black Gate and no mortal man can stand in its path…",,N,MiShofMo-1,MiShofMo-3

MiShofMo-23,,,Talion,"They’re not Orcs, they’re Uruks. They’re far worse and there’s too many. Go find your mother. Go find your mother, keep her safe. I’ll be right behind you, go.",,N,MiShofMo-22,MiShofMo-24

MiShofMo-26,,,Elf Ghost,You are banished from death.,,N,MiShofMo-25,MiShofMo-27
MiShofMo-27,,,,[The sword in Talion’s hand turns into a bouquet of Niphredil. We hear a woman humming and Talion flows into another memory.],,Y,MiShofMo-26,MiShofMo-28

MiShofMo-95,,,Talion,Well this doesn’t bode well.,,N,MiShofMo-94,MiShofMo-96

MiShofMo-103,,,Talion,So you didn’t die ten years ago.,,N,MiShofMo-102,MiShofMo-104
MiShofMo-104,,,Man,"I take it you did not come here to arrest me for treason, Captain.",,N,MiShofMo-103,MiShofMo-105
MiShofMo-105,,,Talion,"You and I are all that remains of that garrison, Hirgon.",,N,MiShofMo-104,MiShofMo-106
MiShofMo-106,,,Hirgon,Then why did you come here?,,N,MiShofMo-105,MiShofMo-107
MiShofMo-107,,,Talion,Looking for a slave that fought the Black Hand of Sauron.,,N,MiShofMo-106,MiShofMo-108
MiShofMo-108,,,Hirgon,More like ran away from him.,,N,MiShofMo-107,MiShofMo-109

MiShofMo-113,,,Talion,This is no time to keep secrets.,,N,MiShofMo-112,MiShofMo-114
MiShofMo-114,,,Hirgon,"I’ve been stuck here for weeks. Steady… Come to the Outcast Camp, we shall ask my scouts.",,N,MiShofMo-113,MiShofMo-115

MiShofMo-128,,,Elf Ghost,"I sense it knows more of me, than I know of myself.",,N,MiShofMo-127,MiShofMo-129
MiShofMo-129,,,Talion,How could a rodent possibly know of a Wraith?,,N,MiShofMo-128,MiShofMo-130
MiShofMo-130,,,Elf Ghost,It is somehow connected to me. I feel it.,,N,MiShofMo-129,MiShofMo-131
MiShofMo-131,,,Talion,Walls are no obstacle for it. The runt’s tracks lead us right into that Caragor cave… There! It’s on the run!,,N,MiShofMo-130,MiShofMo-132
MiShofMo-132,,,,[],,Y,MiShofMo-131,MiShofMo-133

MiShofMo-139,,,,[],,Y,MiShofMo-138,MiShofMo-140
MiShofMo-140,,,Talion,You wretched creature! What do you want?! Quick! It is escaping! Uruk hunters… they must’ve tracked the Caragors here. Your cowardly creature larks around here somewhere.,,N,MiShofMo-139,MiShofMo-141
MiShofMo-141,,,Gollum,"He will remember. Precious… We will make him.  Yes, yes, yes! We must have it back - We must have it.  Quiet, quiet Precious.",(changes personality) (changes personality) ,N,MiShofMo-140,MiShofMo-142
MiShofMo-142,,,Talion,"You think you can sneak up on me so easily, eh?!",,N,MiShofMo-141,MiShofMo-143
MiShofMo-143,,,Gollum,"No! No, don’t hurts us!",,N,MiShofMo-142,MiShofMo-144

MiShofMo-151,,,Gollum,Yes! We swears! We swears to serve the Bright Master! We takes him to his treasures. Gollum! Gollum!,,N,MiShofMo-150,MiShofMo-152
MiShofMo-152,,,Talion,I do not trust him.,,N,MiShofMo-151,MiShofMo-153

MiShofMo-156,,,Talion,Now what would you know that all these other dead Orcs didn’t?,,N,MiShofMo-155,MiShofMo-157
MiShofMo-157,,,Ratbag,"Go ahead, ya bastard! Do it! I’ll die and you’ll know nothing.",,N,MiShofMo-156,MiShofMo-158
MiShofMo-158,,,Talion,Maybe I’ll grant you request… end your miserable life.,,N,MiShofMo-157,MiShofMo-159
MiShofMo-159,,,Ratbag,"No. NO, no, no, no! I was jesting. Look, those slaves are no match for the Orc army. Their scheme’s as rotten as barrel ﬁsh! But Ratbag can teach you the ways of the Orc… Ratbag can make your plan work!",,N,MiShofMo-158,MiShofMo-160
MiShofMo-160,,,Talion,We’re going to ﬁnd out what you know.,,N,MiShofMo-159,MiShofMo-161
MiShofMo-161,,,,[Talion uses his powers to read Ratbag’s mind.],,Y,MiShofMo-160,MiShofMo-162
MiShofMo-162,,,Ratbag,"Your problem. Ranger, is the Warchiefs. Strong leaders, they are. Now if somethin’ were to happen to them, then they wouldn’t be able to stomp your little insurrection, would they?",,N,MiShofMo-161,MiShofMo-163
MiShofMo-163,,,Talion,I would hunt them down.,,N,MiShofMo-162,MiShofMo-164
MiShofMo-164,,,Ratbag,How? They’re not very popular around here. And they know it.,,N,MiShofMo-163,MiShofMo-165
MiShofMo-165,,,Talion,But you can ﬁnd them?,,N,MiShofMo-164,MiShofMo-166

MiShofMo-168,,,Ratbag,"Marvellous. Now let’s stop fafﬁn’ about, eh. First I need to take care of a certain Captain. And a few Caragors. Come with me, Ranger. You can’t trust them! Those Slaves’ll stab you in the back. At least an Uruk will stab you in the front… Most likely the throat. We have similar goals, Ranger! See, you want to kill the Cap’n and somebody’s got to take his place. Somebody like Ratbag.",,N,MiShofMo-167,MiShofMo-169
MiShofMo-169,,,Talion,So this Goroth is in charge?,,N,MiShofMo-168,MiShofMo-170
MiShofMo-170,,,Ratbag,"Of this camp, yea. But he’s no Warchief. They answer directly to The Black Hand. I’ll show them all when I’m in The Black Hand’s inner circle. Becoming a Captain is just the ﬁrst step of Ratbag’s plan to become a Warchief.",,N,MiShofMo-169,MiShofMo-171
MiShofMo-171,,,Talion,Then prepare to step hard on his neck.,,N,MiShofMo-170,MiShofMo-172

MiShofMo-174,,,,[Talion defends Ratbag.],,Y,MiShofMo-173,MiShofMo-175
MiShofMo-175,,,Ratbag,"Well done, Ranger. Now just picture all these corpses as Goroth. Visualize your goals. Goroth’s been out for Ratbag for years. Smug piece of dung that he is. We come to blows as far back as Ratbag can remember… Still, Ratbag never wins. Last time he kicks Ratbag into the Caragor pit. All the others laughed as the Caragor bats Ratbag around like a yarn ball.

MiShofMo-182,,,Talion,Goroth’s in the Hunting Camp… so much for him ALWAYS being in the same place. A Captain who fears his own beast.,,N,MiShofMo-181,MiShofMo-183

MiShofMo-501,,,Torvin,"I do, Cap’n. And since you’re so good at taking orders, I’ll tell ya how step by step. Step one: When he’s crunchin’ on an Uruk, sneak up behind the giant beast and bleed the bastard’s ankle.",,N,MiShofMo-500,MiShofMo-502
MiShofMo-502,,,Talion,Why not his throat?,,N,MiShofMo-501,MiShofMo-503
MiShofMo-503,,,Torvin,There’s one place Graug’s aren’t covered in spiky scales. They don’t call a weakness a Graug’s heel for nothing.,,N,MiShofMo-502,MiShofMo-504

MiShofMo-509,,,Talion,That’ll be quite a ride. I need a Caragor for speed.,,N,MiShofMo-508,MiShofMo-510

MiShofMo-531,,,Talion,The darkness of Mordor doesn’t seem to touch that Dwarf.,,N,MiShofMo-530,MiShofMo-532
MiShofMo-532,,,Calebrimbor,The seven rings of power did not turn the Dwarf Kings to Wraiths as the nine rings did to Men. They are as stubborn as stone and cannot be dominated by evil. That is why Sauron has sworn to destroy them.,,N,MiShofMo-531,MiShofMo-533
MiShofMo-533,,,Talion,Torvin?,,N,MiShofMo-532,MiShofMo-534

MiShofMo-535,,,Talion,I assume you know the path?,,N,MiShofMo-534,MiShofMo-536
MiShofMo-536,,,Torvin,"The real question is: are you ready to travel it? Whatever happens during the hunt, think: what would Torvin do. Actually, that’s a good lesson for you to follow always. I pray your training sticks… Or else you’ll stick to the wall, once Mighty Graug hurls you there.",,N,MiShofMo-535,MiShofMo-537

MiShofMo-538,,,Torvin,"And that’s just what you’d do. Fight. No art, no ﬁnesse. The hunt isn’t about swinging and slashing, It’s bigger than that!",,N,MiShofMo-537,MiShofMo-539
MiShofMo-539,,,Talion,"From your perspective, Dwarf, everything is bigger.",,N,MiShofMo-538,MiShofMo-540
MiShofMo-540,,,Torvin,"Yes, this Graug is very VERY big. Oh… Wait… You’re mocking me. Graugs are one of the oldest specimen in Mordor.., and the deadliest by far. It’s been a long time since I faced this Graug. Let us hope time wasn’t as gentle to him as it was to me. My old partner and I once tracked a Graug from Mount Dolmed to Nogrod. We ﬁnally slayed it and got stuck under his leg for two days! Those were fun times. Last time I saw the beast was when my old partner and I tracked It into its dwelling.",,N,MiShofMo-539,MiShofMo-541
MiShofMo-541,,,Talion,How did yen get out alive?,,N,MiShofMo-540,MiShofMo-542
MiShofMo-542,,,Torvin,"Luck. The Graug knocked me senseless. When I came to, it had ended my partner. Facing that creature alone was a death sentence. I’ve been hunting this Graug for almost a decade. That’s a lot of years of dedication to one beast.",,N,MiShofMo-541,MiShofMo-543
MiShofMo-543,,,Talion,Dedication? Or a sign you preach better than you hunt.,,N,MiShofMo-542,MiShofMo-544
MiShofMo-544,,,Torvin,"That’s funny, Cap’n. I’ll be sure to laugh when the beast eats you alive. The Mighty Graug will be my legacy. Dwarf will tell tales of Torvin the Hunter for generations. And I’ll have ‘em throw your name in there somewhere.",,N,MiShofMo-543,MiShofMo-545
MiShofMo-545,,,,[They find The Mighty Graug’s cave.],,Y,MiShofMo-544,MiShofMo-546
