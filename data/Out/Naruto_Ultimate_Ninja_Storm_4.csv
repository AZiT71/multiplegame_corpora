My mother, Kaguya Otsutsuki, came to your land from a very distant place. She came to harvest the fruit of the Divine Tree. In this war, you saw the Divine Tree as well, didn't you? She harvested its chakra fruit. She ingested the fruit, acquired its power, and then came to rule this land. But a power that's too strong creates conflict. In the end, people both worshiped her as the Rabbit Goddess, and feared her as a devil... Then, Kaguya gave birth to two sons. One of them… was me. In order to atone for the sins that our mother left behind, we fought with the Ten Tails, the incarnation of the Divine Tree... The Divine Tree had gone berserk, and was trying to reclaim the fruit that had been taken from it. It was a violent battle... We were both wounded, but we persevered, achieved victory, and sealed the Ten Tails inside me. Then, some time passed... and I fathered two sons. I named the elder one Indra, the younger one Asura, and taught them about Ninshu. They were both my sons, but there was one big difference between them. One possessed genes that had strongly inherited my chakra, while the other's was rather weak... Indra was truly a genius. He could do anything on his own, and took pride in how he was ""different"" from other people. In contrast, Asura never seemed to succeed in anything, and he wasn't able to achieve anything on his own. Therefore, he always put forth effort and depended on help from his allies. They also answered Asura's calls for help, which created ""harmony."" Through watching how Asura lived… I caught a glimpse a new possibility. That's when decided to entrust Ninshu to Asura.

You never cut me off. You just kept moving closer to my heart.

We used to do nothing but quarrel... and now we can feel the pain of each other's hearts. And this isn't just between us.

People became shinobi, and created clans and villages. Even during peaceful interludes… the flames of war never died out, but grew ever stronger… along with hatred. And so, those two continued to late each other, fighting on and on. However… a single ninja… was able to sever that chain and cultivate a new future. He created best friends, followed them, challenged them, and connected them. His will… gradually came to encompass all shinobi, the world, and all its hatred… until it came to reveal a new path. Here, the handbook that encompasses everything about the way of the shinobi reaches its conclusion. It’s time to give that handbook a title… And so it will be named… The Tale of Naruto Uzumaki.",,N,NaUlNiSt4-1523,NaUlNiSt4-1525
