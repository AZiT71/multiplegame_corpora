ThEvWi2-25,Into the Flame,,KIDMAN,We can rewrite history if we want to. Staging a death is child's play. Why would I come out of the shadows just to lie to you? Lily is alive. And she's with us. But she's in danger. We need you to help save her.,,N,ThEvWi2-24,ThEvWi2-26

ThEvWi2-40,Into the Flame,,THE ADMINISTRATOR,The Beacon Mental Hospital Incident was... an unfortunate setback. But we used the knowledge gained to build a new and vastly improved STEM system.,,N,ThEvWi2-39,ThEvWi2-41
ThEvWi2-41,Into the Flame,,SEBASTIAN,What does this have to do with my daughter?,,N,ThEvWi2-40,ThEvWi2-42
ThEvWi2-42,Into the Flame,,THE ADMINISTRATOR,Imagine it: millions of minds connected together. Happiness for one is happiness for all. This machine - this miracle - will allow our species to achieve greatness. We needed to start with a mind that was pure and clean enough to support thousands of personalities.

ThEvWi2-46,Into the Flame,,THE ADMINISTRATOR,"Think about this. Mr. Castellanos: I am providing you an opportunity. Not only to see your daughter again, but to save her life.

ThEvWi2-49,Into the Flame,,SEBASTIAN,That's all right. I'm fine by myself.,,N,ThEvWi2-48,ThEvWi2-50
ThEvWi2-50,Into the Flame,,KIDMAN,"Just remember to call me the moment you find Lily so that we can begin the extraction process. I'll be out here for you… And someone else will be IN THERE for you.

ThEvWi2-75,THE EVIL WITHIN 2,,KIDMAN,This STEM environment was designed to look and feel like a small town called Union.,,N,ThEvWi2-74,ThEvWi2-76

ThEvWi2-90,Something Not Quite Right,,SEBASTIAN,"Hoffman. Psychology and surveillance? This one could be cagey. Sykes. A tech, but at least he has some small arms training. O'Neal. They must not have been expecting trouble if they sent in all these technicians. Harrison. Combat specialist, huh? Hopefully he can take care of himself. Baker. Team leader. He's the guy I should try to find first. Lily, your team, and now me... We're all stuck inside STEM... I still don't understand why you can't just take them all out of their pods and wake them up.",,N,ThEvWi2-89,ThEvWi2-91
ThEvWi2-91,Something Not Quite Right,,KIDMAN,"It doesn't work that way Without a Core, we're totally locked out of the system. To forcibly remove anyone from STEM at this point would kill them and leave their consciousness trapped inside there.",,N,ThEvWi2-90,ThEvWi2-92

ThEvWi2-96,Something Not Quite Right,,SEBASTIAN,You wouldn't have told me about Lily if your damned machine didn't go on the fritz. I would have spent the rest of my life mourning her and you wouldn't have cared.,,N,ThEvWi2-95,ThEvWi2-97
ThEvWi2-97,Something Not Quite Right,,KIDMAN,I cared. But I couldn't say anything. They would have killed me.,,N,ThEvWi2-96,ThEvWi2-98

ThEvWi2-597,On the Hunt,,SEBASTIAN,"The big Emitter's back on, but this place is still falling apart. And I think it's all because of this psycho that kidnapped Lily. He's running loose in Union and can manipulate this place at will.",,N,ThEvWi2-596,ThEvWi2-598
ThEvWi2-598,On the Hunt,,HOFFMAN,"That means my theory is correct. This is more than a Core dis-connect. We doctors don't like to use the term ""psycho"" in pejorative terms.

ThEvWi2-599,On the Hunt,,SEBASTIAN,You're a shrink. Any suggestions on how to defeat him?,,N,ThEvWi2-598,ThEvWi2-600
ThEvWi2-600,On the Hunt,,HOFFMAN,"Psychopaths are antisocial, lack empathy, and exhibit sadistic tendencies. But their main commonality is their pathologic egocentricity.

ThEvWi2-601,On the Hunt,,SEBASTIAN,Yeah. He thinks he's some sort of artist. It's all he talks about...,,N,ThEvWi2-600,ThEvWi2-602
ThEvWi2-602,On the Hunt,,HOFFMAN,Then maybe the best way to attack him would be through his art. Destroying something valuable to him could knock him off of his guard.,,N,ThEvWi2-601,ThEvWi2-603
ThEvWi2-603,On the Hunt,,SEBASTIAN,I'll keep that in mind. But I've got to get to him first. He's holed himself up in the Theater.,,N,ThEvWi2-602,ThEvWi2-604
ThEvWi2-604,On the Hunt,,HOFFMAN,"Right. So Exit D5, then. It's right here, just in the next room. Let's pair our Communicators so that we can stay in touch.

ThEvWi2-606,On the Hunt,,HOFFMAN,"Sorry to break it to you, but she does. I thought it was the truth, too, until just now. But over the years. I've learned to take everything Mobius tells me with a pinch of salt. It wasn't difficult to see you were telling the truth.",,N,ThEvWi2-605,ThEvWi2-607

ThEvWi2-608,On the Hunt,,HOFFMAN,I know it's not right. But consider this. Lily is probably less traumatized by thinking you're dead than by thinking you're alive but she can't be wit.,,N,ThEvWi2-607,ThEvWi2-609
ThEvWi2-609,On the Hunt,,SEBASTIAN,Yeah. Maybe. But what will happen when I finally find her?,,N,ThEvWi2-608,ThEvWi2-610
ThEvWi2-610,On the Hunt,,HOFFMAN,Don't worry. She'll believe the evidence of her eyes once she sees you.,,N,ThEvWi2-609,ThEvWi2-611
ThEvWi2-611,On the Hunt,,SEBASTIAN,"If Mobius knew to keep psychopaths out of STEM, then how did one end up in here?",,N,ThEvWi2-610,ThEvWi2-612

ThEvWi2-613,On the Hunt,,SEBASTIAN,"Yeah. Well, that didn't work.",,N,ThEvWi2-612,ThEvWi2-614
ThEvWi2-614,On the Hunt,,HOFFMAN,"Unfortunately, psychopathy and sociopathy are incredibly difficult to diagnose correctly. Psychopaths tend to be cunning and highly intelligent.
