Me-1,﻿Intro ,,,"[We see a gloomy sorcerer's castle, with crows flying around it. The camera flies around several of its rooms showing various ingenious magical devices and then descends into the basement, where we see the sorcerer Zarok himself. His skin is wrinkled, insects are running around - everything indicates that we have a living corpse before us. Zarok flips through the book of spells, finds the right one, takes his staff and goes to the hill next to the city. Under the rumble of thunder, Zarok swings his staff and released a wave of green energy. Next, he enters the city itself. He lifts his staff and releases the rays of green energy that hit the inhabitants of the city, stealing their souls and turning them into zombies. Stolen souls suck in Zarok's staff. Then the sorcerer goes to the cemetery, emitting a green glow. Above the gates of the cemetery, there is a wrought-iron plate called ""Fortesque"". Under the influence of green light, the trees become evil monsters and the corpses rise from the graves. But Zarok overlooks one thing - having awakened the dead, he inadvertently woke up his sworn enemy. The green glow strikes him like lightning and, seeing a glimpse of his past life, Sir Daniel Fortesque rise up from the grave.]",,Y,,Me-2
