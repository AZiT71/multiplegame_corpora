The tree’s very existence supports all of creation along its boughs its life energy interwoven into the tapestry of life… birth, growth, death, and rebirth… every strand, transcending time, transcending space.

Every realm has a travel rune that unlocks the bridge to that realm. I’m giving you the one for Alfheim. Now you can lock in your destination. We’re ready. Remember to take the Bifröst you don’t want to lose that. Now the realm travel bridge will align, and the realm between realms will open. See that giant crystal? Each realm has a corresponding one that focuses and amplifies the power of the Bifröst, opening the bridge to that realm.

She was a gifted sorceress who gathered every tome or arcane wisdom she could find in the realms, all in the hopes of augmenting her powers of prophecy that she might find her lost husband, Aurvandil. But it was not her husband she would glimpse in her visions- for it was Gróa, sending longer and farther than any before or since, who witnessed Ragnarök- the end and the beginning. When Odin caught word of her ultimate prophecy, he maneuvered to obtain her knowledge and hoard it for himself. Gróa knew Odin as a longtime patron of her services, and so she welcomed him into her library as a friend. What she did not know is that Odin himself was behind her husband’s disappearance, having used is enchantments to conceal his death at Thor’s hands from her sight. Smiling, jealous Odin took her by the throat, and with his very hands he stole her library and her life for his own.",,N,GoOfWa20-2218,GoOfWa20-2220

There he gives Hrungnir his full of mead, and goads him into all manner of boast and antics, all for the amusement of the court. I was there- I saw the Aesir laugh as Hrungnir leapt upon his shield and swore he’d kill us all and take our womenfolk tack to Jötunheim. Then Thor shows up- and does he laugh? Oh, no. Thor takes one look at the drunken stone buffoon, and brings down Mjölnir on his head so hard that he’s got chunks of Hrungnir in his own skull to this day.

Once he longed to fight Thor, but tragedy had brought wisdom to Hrimthur— and cunning. He observed that Asgard’s walls were half-built and shoddy, for no Aesir god could be bothered with such tiresome labour. So Hrimthur adopted the guise of an ordinary man, and made the Aesir an offer he would build them majestic new walls, and if he couldn’t build them within two turns of the season, they would owe him nothing for his labours. And if he succeeded, he asked only for an audience with the goddess Freya. Odin agreed, knowing the task was impossible, but intrigued by this stranger. Hrimthur made short work of it, of course he had the benefit of his father’s training, and the aid of a magical stallion for fetching stones. Odin was not happy to find himself on the losing end of the wager, but he seemed to uphold his end of the bargain. Freya was sent to meet the mason, and to her surprise, he wanted only to whisper something in her ear. That being done, he made his way out of Asgard… and when he found Thor waiting him at the gates of Midgard, he knew he had been double-crossed.
