DuSi3-1,﻿PROLOGUE,,Odo,"We are the 10th Legion... exiles from a dying Empire, who founded the kingdom of Ehb. For four hundred years, we guided and protected our people. We gave them peace... prosperity... fair judgment. Some say it was the death of the old king that turned the people against us. But it was Jeyne Kassynder who took up the sword and drove us from our chapterhouses and estates. I was not there for the final battle, when the last of our Legion faced Jeyne Kassynder, beneath and boughs of an ancient, hallowed tree. Nor do I know what power she called upon, in that forest, to murder my comrades and friends. After that, the forest was changed - twisted and ruined. Only Jeyne walked out of that place alive. Thirty years have passed since the Legion was destroyed, and Ehb has suffered in that time. War rages without end, between Jeyne Kassynder the east and the royal family in the west. A few sons and daughters of the Legion remain. You are one of their number.",,N,,DuSi3-2

DuSi3-7,﻿PROLOGUE,,Odo,"I write to you, my young friend, with urgent news. I know your childhood has not been easy, passed from one sympathetic household to the next, always one step ahead of our enemies. Your father, Hugh Montbarron, was our last Grand Master, and he would have wanted a better life for his son. But he and your mother are long dead... murdered by Jeyne Kassynder. As the last survivor of the old Legion, I've tried my best to keep you safe - to ensure that you are trained in the manner of your forefathers, with sword and shield. But Jeyne Kassynder hunts for us still. Now I fear that her spies may be getting close. We cannot delay any longer. We still have a chance to join together, rebuild the Legion, and take our country back from Jeyne Kassynder, before it's too late. The sons and daughters of the Legion are gathering in the north, at your family's old estate. I urge you to join us in the valley of Rukkenvahl, as quickly as you can. Help us restore all that was lost. Your faithful friend. Odo.",,N,DuSi3-6,DuSi3-8

DuSi3-9,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,I was afraid everyone else was dead. Are you all right?,,N,DuSi3-8,DuSi3-10
DuSi3-10,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,I'm fine. But who are you? Have we met?,,N,DuSi3-9,DuSi3-11
DuSi3-11,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,"No... but I've seen portraits of the Montbarron family, and you can only be Hugh Montbarron's son. My name is Marten Guiscard, and I'm a friend of Odo’s - and a son of the Legion, like you.",,N,DuSi3-10,DuSi3-12
DuSi3-12,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,"When I got here, the house was on fire, and everyone was dead. How did this happen?",,N,DuSi3-11,DuSi3-13
DuSi3-13,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,We didn't have any warning. They surrounded the house and hit us fast. I don't even know who hired them. Damn - they've found us again! We can't wait any longer. I've set a trap... three kegs of gunpowder on the bridge below. Thought I'd cover my escape if they found me. All we need to do is light the fuses. Come on - to the bridge!,,N,DuSi3-12,DuSi3-14
DuSi3-14,A Gathering in the North,,,[],,Y,DuSi3-13,DuSi3-15
DuSi3-15,A Gathering in the North,,Odo,"The Montbarron Estate burned, and with it my dream of a reborn 10th Legion. Or so I thought. I did not know that you and Marten Guiscard had escaped the destruction. As you fled into the night, you bore with you the future of the Legion. Pursued by enemies, ﬂeeing toward uncertain fate, you made your way across the empty leagues of the Rukkenvahl. Throughout the journey, you were driven by a single hope - that others had survived the devastation, and that they reached the safety of the Rukkenvahl Chapterhouse. It was a slender hope, to be sure, but even small hope can warm a man in the cold dark of night. As long as you drew breath, the 10th Legion yet lived, but your fees pressed close about, hunting you. The fate of the Legion - he fate of Ehb itself - rested with you...",,N,DuSi3-14,DuSi3-16
DuSi3-16,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,"I know this part of the valley. We've come a long way... I think were close to the old Legion Chapterhouse. If any of our friends are still alive, that's where they'll be.",,N,DuSi3-15,DuSi3-17
DuSi3-17,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,Tell me about the attack. What do you remember?,,N,DuSi3-16,DuSi3-18
DuSi3-18,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,"Odo sent letters to all the descendants of the Legion. He wanted to gather them here, train them as legionnaires, and take back the country. Most had already arrived, when the mercenaries found us. They surrounded the estate. Must have killed the men who were on watch. They smashed through the windows and the doors. Slaughtered everyone they could find. Then they set fire to the house.",,N,DuSi3-17,DuSi3-19
DuSi3-19,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,"How many people were in the estate, when you were attacked?",,N,DuSi3-18,DuSi3-20
DuSi3-20,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,"Almost forty... all sons and daughters of the Legion. Some of them had fought in the wars, but the rest... they were no match for those soldiers. We can hope that a few survived, but most of them are dead. Our enemies didn't seem interested in prisoners.",,N,DuSi3-19,DuSi3-21
DuSi3-21,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,Those mercenary soldiers... have you fought them before?,,N,DuSi3-20,DuSi3-22
DuSi3-22,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,"They were Lescanzi. I think. A wandering people, from the desert in the north. I have no idea who sent them here. Lescanzi will fight for anyone who pays them. No, our real enemy hasn't shown himself... or herself. Not yet.",,N,DuSi3-21,DuSi3-23
DuSi3-23,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,Did you see what happened to Odo?,,N,DuSi3-22,DuSi3-24
DuSi3-24,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,"No. I lost sight of him when the fire started. But we agreed to meet at the old Chapterhouse, if anything went wrong.",,N,DuSi3-23,DuSi3-25
DuSi3-25,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,That's enough about the attack for now.,,N,DuSi3-24,DuSi3-26
DuSi3-26,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,Right. Maybe Odo can tell us more... if he's alive.,,N,DuSi3-25,DuSi3-27
DuSi3-27,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,I've never been here before. Does this valley have a name?,,N,DuSi3-26,DuSi3-28
DuSi3-28,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,"They call it the Rukkenvahl. It's hard country. Not easy to control, even with an army. That's why Odo chose this place. He thought we'd be safe here, while we trained a new Legion.",,N,DuSi3-27,DuSi3-29
DuSi3-29,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,How many people live out here?,,N,DuSi3-28,DuSi3-30
DuSi3-30,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,"Only a few. There's a village - Raven's Rill. Most of the people are hunters and trappers, from all I've heard. Pilgrims and merchants used to come here, before the Legion fell. Made the town rich. But that was years ago, when the roads were still safe.",,N,DuSi3-29,DuSi3-31
DuSi3-31,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,"Was my father born here, in the Rukkenvahl?",,N,DuSi3-30,DuSi3-32
DuSi3-32,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,"I think so. The Montbarrons were granted their land by King Konreid, and the family lived here, ever since. Another Legion family had a manor here, too. The Gunderics... an old line. Your father didn't trust them.",,N,DuSi3-31,DuSi3-33
DuSi3-33,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,You said this is hard country. Are there any dangers I should know about?,,N,DuSi3-32,DuSi3-34
DuSi3-34,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,"Spiders. They're as large as a man, and they're smart. They'll ambush travelers on the road. And there's worse things in the forest. Have you heard of the dakkenweyr... the Beast Lords? In other parts of Ehb, they're only stories. Out here... believe me they're all too real.",,N,DuSi3-33,DuSi3-35
DuSi3-35,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,Thank you. That's all I need to know about the valley.,,N,DuSi3-34,DuSi3-36
DuSi3-36,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,"Sorry I couldn't tell you more. I've only been here for a few weeks, myself.",,N,DuSi3-35,DuSi3-37
DuSi3-37,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,The Legion had a chapterhouse here? In this valley?,,N,DuSi3-36,DuSi3-38
DuSi3-38,A Gathering in the North,,Marten Guiscard,"They built chapterhouses in every part of Ehb. Even in remote places, like this. They were strongholds where legionnaires would meet. Sometimes in fellowship, sometimes for war. You should have seen the Grand Chapterhouse in Stonebridge... headquarters for the whole Legion. My father took me inside it, once.",,N,DuSi3-37,DuSi3-39
DuSi3-39,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,Let's keep moving. We can talk more later.,,N,DuSi3-38,DuSi3-40

DuSi3-43,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,Out of the way. We have no business with you.,,N,DuSi3-42,DuSi3-44
DuSi3-44,A Gathering in the North,,Bogdan,"Spoken like a man of the 10th Legion - arrogant and foolhardy. Lucky for me, I found you first. That means I'll get a handsome bonus for your heads.",,N,DuSi3-43,DuSi3-45

DuSi3-52,A Gathering in the North,,The Venerable Odo,The others? The men and women I've kept safe for thirty years? Dead... all of them.,,N,DuSi3-51,DuSi3-53
DuSi3-53,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,Do you have any idea who’s behind this?,,N,DuSi3-52,DuSi3-54
DuSi3-54,A Gathering in the North,,The Venerable Odo,"I can think of a few possibilities. Jeyne Kassynder, for one. As long as were alive, we're a threat... a symbol of the nation she destroyed. And there's the royal court... or what's left of it. They may still blame the Legion for the old king’s death.",,N,DuSi3-53,DuSi3-55
DuSi3-55,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,That's two possibilities. Any others?,,N,DuSi3-54,DuSi3-56
DuSi3-56,A Gathering in the North,,The Venerable Odo,Anyone who stands to profit from civil war and bedlam. That's a long and formidable list.,,N,DuSi3-55,DuSi3-57
DuSi3-57,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,You don't seem hurt. How did you get out?,,N,DuSi3-56,DuSi3-58
DuSi3-58,A Gathering in the North,,The Venerable Odo,"I rounded up a few of our people... the only ones who hadn't been killed. Reynald. Hanna... and one of the twins from Drakkenberg... Giles, I think. We jumped from the second floor of the house, made a break for the woods.",,N,DuSi3-57,DuSi3-59
DuSi3-59,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,Tell me the rest.,,N,DuSi3-58,DuSi3-60
DuSi3-60,A Gathering in the North,,The Venerable Odo,Some of the mercenaries saw us. They fired their guns. I heard one of the others cry out. Then there were more Lescanzi in front of us. We tried to fight our way through. By the time it was over... the others were dead. All I could do was make my way here.,,N,DuSi3-59,DuSi3-61
DuSi3-61,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,Who else could have survived? We need to find them.,,N,DuSi3-60,DuSi3-62
DuSi3-62,A Gathering in the North,,The Venerable Odo,"My ward... Anjali. I sent her to keep watch for latecomers. She wasn't at the estate, when we were attacked. And there's another survivor, too. The half-blood Lescanzi girl. I couldn't convince her to join us before, but things are different now. Might have been one or two others who hadn't arrived yet, when we were attacked. Hard to say.",,N,DuSi3-61,DuSi3-63
DuSi3-63,A Gathering in the North,,Lucas,"Odo, who is this ward of yours?",,N,DuSi3-62,DuSi3-64
DuSi3-64,A Gathering in the North,,The Venerable Odo,Anjali. My adopted daughter. She's... unique. Has a foreign look about her. Resourceful girl. Learned that from me. Fights with a spear. She'll be hard to miss.,,N,DuSi3-63,DuSi3-65

DuSi3-70,A Gathering in the North,,The Venerable Odo,"I agree. You're bleeding, Guiscard, and you can barely stand up. I'll do what I can for Marten, but he'll be no help to you, not like this. I'm sorry... you'll be on your own, until you find the others.",,N,DuSi3-69,DuSi3-71

DuSi3-1235,Last of an Ancient Line,,Odo,"You bid farewell to the Radiant Youth, and he sent you back to our chapterhouse in Stonebridge, where I awaited your return. In the weeks that followed, news spread of Jeyne Kassynder's defeat. Your armies scattered, giving us time to rest and regroup. Marten Guiscard returned safely from the Spire, along with Meister Wulf and the automaton army. Only a few weeks later, elections were held in Stonebridge. Meister Wulf, who is had been so public in his support of the Legion, almost won the office of Mayor. But he was defeated in the end. Many people had wanted the Dapper Old Gent to hang. They resented the fact that the Legion had spared his life, and they blamed poor Wulf. After the humiliating events in the Foundry, Meister Kassel was forced to resign as guildmaster of ironmongers. The cyclopses negotiated a new contract for higher wages, and with the help of Meister Fiddlewick, formed a new workers' union. For the first time in a hundred years, they were permitted to leave the Foundry and spend their newfound wealth in the markets and taverns of Stonebridge. Cyclopses are becoming an increasingly common sight in Stonebridge... and many believe that they will eventually take their place as equal citizens of the town. Archambraud du Payen - formely known as the Dapper Old Gent - proved a valuable addition to the Legion. His knowledge of Legion magic allowed us to retake control of the Sentinels that had long guarded our chapterhouses and estates. But the Gent couldn't leave our chapterhouse without drawing an angry mob. His confinement started to drive him mad. So he returned to his beloved Causeways, beneath an endless sky... and he dwells there still. The following winter was a harsh one in the Rukkenvahl... just as Lazar Bassili feared. Without any trade from the south, the people of Raven’s Rill went hungry and many dies. Among them were a widow Ludmila and Lazar’s friend and scribe, Grigori. When spring came, the dead were mourned, and Lazar’s people did their best to carry on. In his last letter to me, Lazar added one other piece of news. Gunderic Manor has a new mistress... a witch called Leona. The Manor has become a gathering place for scores of Lescanzi witches... many of whom are apparently quite beautiful. Lazar reports that the young men of Raven’s Rill have also begun frequenting the Manor... much to the irritation of their mothers and wives. Since the local men will not hear any talk of banishing the witches, it appears that Leona and their people have found a new home... which was, perhaps, what she intended from the fit. Queen Roslyn abandoned Glitterdelve, embarking on a tour of all the cities and towns of the west, meeting as many of her subjects as she could. The queen showed all the energy of youth, and I think she fully expects to reunite the country in a matter of months, not years. Realty not be so kind, as Lord Devonsey has tried to make her understand. In truth, the future of this country depends more upon that we decide. If she doesn’t have the Legion behind her, the Queen is only a single voice, well-meaning though she might be. As for Devonsey himself... I think the man was impressed by your decision to spare Jeyne Kassynder, as the Queen had asked. When he visit Stonebridge, he spent a great deal of time in our chapterhouse. I believe he may actually be willing to rejoin our ranks... if we choose to accept him. Rajani and her sisters returned to Stonebridge... quietly, and carefully disguised. Jeyne Kassynder's defeat affected them deeply,' though not in the way I expected. Their devotion to Jeyne was replaced by a deep admiration for your companion Anjali. I think they saw in Anjali the leader they should have followed all along, and they have lately expressed a desire to join our ranks. I maintain my suspicion of any archon who once followed Jeyne.… but I believe that redemption is not impossible, even, for them. Jeyne Kassynder was as good as her word... though I had my doubts, at first. She returned to the cities and towns of the east and urged the people to end their war with the Legion and the Crown. Jeyne s repentance was heartfelt, and many were swayed by her words But others have not been so compliant. The Church Synod in Bisselberg - who once called Jeyne a saint - have declared her apostate and threatened her life. Though Jeyne refuses bodyguards of any kind, Queen Roslyn fears for her life. And if anything befalls her, our gains in the east may yet be lost. As for the Legion? The rest of our story is yet to be told. We have a nation to reforge... a fellowship to rebuild... and old enemies who would see us destroyed. And we have questions to decide. Who will assume true power in Ehb, if the nation is restored? And who will take the mantle of Grand Master? But this matters I leave for another chronicle, and another time. Whatever happens, know that you will not face the future alone. The Legion will stand by you... always",,N,DuSi3-1234,DuSi3-1236
